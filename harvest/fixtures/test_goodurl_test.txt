<dc:description>This thesis examines the exegetical, intellectual-historical, and theoretical implications of a particular feature of Philip Sidney?s late sixteenth-century sonnet sequence Astrophil and Stella:  its continual anxiety over authenticity ? a term I use to signal the ability of its fictional speaker (Astrophil) to find a language capable of conveying his internal cognitive and affective states.  Throughout Sidney?s sequence, Astrophil attempts to define an authentic lyrical language by both criticizing other poets and asserting a formal agenda for his own texts.  His texts, however, continually contradict in practice what is demanded of them in theory so that the sequence shows an underlying pessimism summed up in Sonnet 35?s question: ?What may words say, or what may words not say, / Where Truth itself must speake like Flatterie?? (my emphasis).&#xd;
This paradox and the pessimism it produces, I argue, can be understood by situating Sidney?s sequence in a rift between two conceptual frameworks for understanding relations between subjectivity, language, and the material world.  In one framework (dominant in western medieval Christendom), cognition, language, and material things were seen as ontologically homogenous ? part of the same sublunary, postlapsarian material stratum.  But in another framework ? emerging in the sixteenth century and that would become dominant in western European modernity ? human subjects and their languages were seen as detached from the material world.   Sidney?s sequence, I suggest, is stuck between these two ideological polarities.  It wants to enact an authenticity that would become possible under the conceptual regime of modernity, where language is imbricated in the immaterial cognitive circuitry of sovereign, Cartesian subjects, and where it thus becomes capable of conveying the authenticity attributed to in modern ideologies of the aesthetic.  However, Sidney is caught in the conceptual space of an older model of language:  one that sees it as something thingly, ontologically homogenous with the material world.  &#xd;
My first chapter introduces ? somewhat lengthily ? the problem of authenticity in Astrophil and Stella.  It develops some of the intellectual-historical horizons I want to situate the sequence in and introduces the main textual feature I want to follow:  Sidney?s tendency, in attempting to establish the authenticity of his own poetry, to criticize other poets for their lack of authenticity vis-?-vis a resemblance between their poetic practices and commercial and economic practices.  My second chapter both turns to the contemporary critical landscape of early modern studies and provides further elaboration of my positioning of Sidney in the ambiguities of early modern concepts of subjectivity, language, and materiality.  After this lengthy prefatory, I move on, in my third chapter, to read Astrophil and Stella, focusing particularly on Sidney?s use of the word ?strange? ? a term that particularly points to the rift I want to chart in the sequence.  My fourth chapter concludes with a methodological question:  how do the points I have made about the difference between modern and early modern ontologies of language, materiality, and subjectivity effect the contemporary critical landscape of early modern literary studies.  Particularly, I pursue the question of whether or not a return to formalism and aestheticism (increasingly called for in protest to the dominance of cultural studies in literary interpretation) has a trans-historical exegetical validity.  In conclusion, I suggest that the assumptions on which such a return to the literary would stand become deeply problematic outside of the modern era.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis examines Virginia Woolf?s 1923 novel Jacob?s Room as a transmission of what Woolf in her unfinished memoir refers to as ?shocks.?  In A Sketch of the Past, Woolf describes the experience of these shocks and her immediate desire to explain them, presenting writing as a reparative activity that imparts meaning to the apparently senseless and alleviates pain by creating wholeness out of fragmentation.  She illustrates this concept by providing three examples from her own childhood, each of which offers a very different model of experience.  In this thesis I relate these shocks to the structure of Jacob?s Room and a number of strangely digressive and open-ended passages within it, proposing that the novel actually resists Woolf's own model of reparative writing and does not process shocks into wholes for the reader so much as transmit them to her.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Proper lumbar support is a necessary and fundamental requirement for any well-designed chair. Objective techniques to assess chair comfort necessitate the use of a sensing layer that may change the fundamental characteristics of the chair itself depending on its structure and materials. Other methods have attached equipment to subjects, which may influence their normal sitting behavior. In this study, I utilize new 3D body scanning technology to examine the person-chair interaction in flexible, material back chairs without adding anything to either the chair or the subject. I attempt to develop a new objective measure, volumetric deformation, which assesses the reaction of a flexible, material chair back to a seated user. In addition, this study aims to understand the relationships between perceived chair back comfort, objective volumetric deformation, subject anthropometric attributes, and ratings of perceived chair attribute comfort. Total chair back deformation is found to be significantly related to some subject anthropometric attributes, which provides further evidence that deformation is a useful objective measure for assessment of the chair back. Perceived overall back comfort is significantly associated to the perceived comfort of the lumbar support but not to any of the anthropometric measurements taken. The relationship between chair back deformation and pressure distribution should be explored in future studies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the last several decades, there has been a shift away from the central planning model in America. Reactions from the grassroots have emerged as citizens strive to address urban needs independently of planning bodies. However, many would argue that this is not the answer either.&#xd;
&#xd;
&lt;br>Planning at the level of urban administration currently coexists in tension with planning at the grassroots level. Planning from the top is attempting to be more attentive to needs in the neighborhoods, as citizens have begun to acquire the energy and resources to lobby for change. Oftentimes, government-grassroots partnerships are forged to exploit the capacities of both entities in planning endeavors. However, this leads to the question of how this tension creates opportunities for improvements of social conditions, whether it contributes to the larger vision of enlarging the political capacity of a society, and which is the appropriate body to make a plan and implement it.&#xd;
&#xd;
&lt;br>A government-grassroots partnership was attempted in the City of Rochester, through the Neighbors Building Neighborhoods (NBN) program. The year 2006 marks the 13th year of the program. After 13 years of negotiations, consultation, community meetings, conflict, and lobbying, numerous milestones have been achieved. Through NBN, hundreds of neighborhood projects have come to fruition, while many others have broken ground. These projects include physical improvements, beautification projects, the construction of new schools and stores, better public services, and increased public safety measures. NBN also received awards for its successful neighborhood revitalization efforts, and is recognized as a model of best practices.&#xd;
&#xd;
&lt;br>Many people in Rochester are happy with the achievements made through NBN. However, some believe that the process can be further modified for greater success. The recent election of a new mayor into the Rochester City administration has resulted in some uncertainty in the future of NBN ? will the process continue as it, be modified, or go down in history as a pet project of the previous administration?&#xd;
This thesis examines the NBN process to:&#xd;
1. document the NBN process in Rochester an example of government-initiated grassroots-planning action that other city planning organizations can refer to;&#xd;
2. place the era of NBN in the context of Rochester's history as a city of citizen action; and&#xd;
3. explore NBN as Rochester's solution to the problem of the appropriate bodies to make a plan and implement it.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study seeks to investigate the effects of emotion on false memory production.  114 &#xd;
undergraduate college students participated in the study.  Subjects were given an emotion &#xd;
induction task that induced positive, negative, or neutral moods by rating person descriptive &#xd;
words taken from the Dumas norms.  Each subject was then asked to listen to lists of study &#xd;
words taken from the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm and was then given an immediate &#xd;
recognition memory test.  One week later, subjects were given a delayed recognition memory test to measure the degree of forgetting.  Results indicate that on the immediate test, although &#xd;
there were no differences observed across emotion conditions for true memory, participants in &#xd;
the negative emotion condition were more prone to produce false memories than those in the &#xd;
positive or neutral conditions.  In addition, there was no main effect of emotion for the &#xd;
immediate test, but there was one for the delayed memory test.  It was found that acceptance &#xd;
rates of both targets and critical distractors decreased for participants in the negative emotion &#xd;
condition relative to positive and neutral conditions.  It was also found that one could inoculate the effects of forgetting on a delayed memory test by giving subjects a prior memory test.</dc:description>

Significant results indicated Black adolescents? advantage on perceived adult and family support, perceived intelligence, self-esteem, active coping skills, and college expectations; Hispanics were advantaged in maternal relationships. White adolescents? resources were parents? education, two biological parent households, two parent households, perceived peer support, and survival expectations. Hispanic and Black adolescents were more likely to be on welfare with the former also suffering through unemployment and the latter living with a single mother.

<dc:description>We examined the choices of 52 adolescents (18 years of age); 26 were enrolled in an alternative to incarceration program and 26 were university undergraduates.  Respondents were presented with a gambling task and were shown two spinners, one offering a sure gain (or loss), the second offering a gamble (probabilities of the gamble included ?, 1/3 and ?; magnitudes of the gamble included low, medium and high monetary amounts).  Participants received 18 trials, nine framed as gains and nine framed as losses (each gain condition was analogous to a loss condition) and individuals were asked to report their confidence after each scenario.  In the gain frame, respondents began with nothing and were offered a choice between a sure gain and a gamble offering the possibility of winning larger amounts or winning nothing.  For the loss frame, individuals were given an endowment and could lose an amount for sure or take a chance and risk losing nothing or risk losing everything.  In each corresponding gain and loss pair, the net sum that could be won was kept equal.  In addition, respondents completed surveys on sensation seeking, behavioral inhibition and behavioral activation.  &#xd;
Data analysis was conducted both without and with the confidence ratings.  In both regressions, delinquents scored significantly higher on sensation seeking in the gain frame, but not in the loss frame.  In the first ANOVA, magnitude was a significant effect as was the interaction between magnitude and the population of the participant.  Delinquents were more likely to choose the gamble regardless of the magnitude, while undergraduates picked the sure option at higher magnitudes.  Also, a three way interaction was found between framing, probability and magnitude.  The second ANOVA, replicated these findings and probability became a significant effect.  Such results highlight the potential benefit of programs that work to enhance decision-making processes in order to prevent initial crime or potential recidivism.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present study sought to discover the age at which infants realize that their vocalizations may be used to elicit social responses from others, and to examine whether infants? knowledge of the consequences of their babbling is related to their primary caregivers? natural levels of responsiveness.  Participants were 27 caregiver-infant dyads from the Ithaca, NY area. Infants were 2 and 5 months of age. Infants participated in an unstructured play session with their caregivers, followed by a still-face interaction with an unfamiliar experimenter who initially engaged the infants, and then became quiet and assumed a neutral expression. Five-month-olds exhibited a significant increase in the quantity of non-cry vocalizations from the first interaction period to the still-face, thus demonstrating that they have learned that their vocalizations have an effect on others. Two-month-olds did not show a significant change in the quantity of vocalizations. No significant relationship was found between caregiver responsiveness and infants' vocal behavior across the still face.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>coping</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The environment of poverty has been implicated as a major risk factor for later childhood adjustment and achievement. The present study examined the effect of exposure to poverty at age 8 on coping at age 13 using measures of coping and family income-to-needs ratio. Additionally, temperament at age 8 was examined as a potential moderator of the relationship between poverty and adolescent coping. The study hypothesized that exposure to poverty at age 8 would predict adolescent?s use of disengagement coping strategies (e.g., avoidance, distraction, or inaction). Temperament was predicted to moderate the relationship between poverty and disengagement coping strategies. Results of regression analyses indicated that exposure to poverty at age 8 predicted adolescent inaction in response to stress. Furthermore, the relationship between poverty status at age 8 and distraction at age 13 was moderated by temperament (age 8).</dc:description>

<dc:title>Profit Priorities and Cost Distribution: Sociocultural and ecological impacts of Chilean forest management</dc:title>

<dc:description>Questions:  What does the government prioritize when facing conflicting social, environmental and economic demands?  What are the impacts and how can these demands be balanced in a responsible, progressive and humanitarian way?&#xd;
&#xd;
This research uses a political ecology framework to discuss the sociocultural, economic and environmental implications of Chilean forest management practices.  This is a critical analysis of the Chilean government?s priorities, which currently promote an extractive export economy at high social and environmental costs.  Despite a growing economy, the wealth disparity in the country is vast and continues to expand.  I argue that the government must reorient its focus away from GDP and toward more valuable measures of the country?s health. Public funds need to be redistributed to benefit the people in the country and the country?s natural treasures rather than subsidizing private industry to attract wealthy foreign investors. This shift in priorities must be implemented in strong, creative policy that supports simultaneous economic growth, environmental preservation, and social justice. &#xd;
This project is based on personal experiences, interviews and observations from when I lived in Chile during the spring of 2006, as well as on secondary sources that provide scientific and statistical evidence.  I describe the history of the forest plantation development, the government?s role in creating the industry that exists today, and current statistics that show the scope and significance of the industry.  Different sources present conflicting evidence depending on their interests, demonstrating the complexity of the controversies around the social and ecological impacts of the forest plantations.  Various avenues for change are possible: policy restructuring, market control methods, improved ecological management, and social and environmental activism promoting government and citizen awareness and responsibility.  Government leaders are integral to promoting human rights and environmental preservation and it is their responsibility to prioritize these goals at least as much as private investment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study was conducted using the DRM paradigm to try to further comprehend false recall positioning. The objective of this study was twofold: to demonstrate that gist, verbatim, and gist + verbatim instructions can alter the positional output of true versus false memories, and to see whether placement of these memories can be affected by other manipulations and their interactions. Results showed that altering the instructions given has a statistically significant effect (at the p &lt;.000 level) in regards to the placement of false memory and true memory,. Significant effects were also witnessed for various other manipulations that confirm the dual process theory. Although the study presented limitations, the results are very useful when applied to criminal investigations and psychotherapy.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Science About What Scientists Do: Distinguishing Between Explanations for Causal Events</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Libby, Laura A.</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>causal reasoning</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>explanation</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The causal reasoning literature suggests that hypothesis testing will only include tests that support a particular hypothesis (confirmation bias), rather than distinguish between possible hypotheses (Wason, 1960; Mynatt, Daugherty, &amp; Tweney, 1977; Klayman &amp; Ha, 1987).  Self-generated hypotheses should elicit a stronger confirmation bias than other-generated hypotheses, possibly because the generation of a hypothesis requires an initial assessment of plausibility (Schunn &amp; Klahr, 1993).  Plausibility is determined by considering a possible cause within a network of prior knowledge about the world (Koslowski, 1996).  Our study examines the testing of genuine explanations in non-emotion-laden, complex causal reasoning situations.  We predict that the source of the explanation (self or other) and presence of alternative explanations will influence ability to distinguish between two hypotheses.  Furthermore, we predict that the incorporation of prior knowledge into the hypothesis test will allow individuals to distinguish more successfully.  Sixty subjects (F = 32, aged 18-22) completed a structured interview evaluating explanations that varied on number of explanations present and source of explanation.  Ability to distinguish between a target explanation and its complement (but not a genuine alternative) was shown to differ based on the source (self or other) of the target and whether an alternative was provided.  Prior knowledge was only used when distinguishing between the target and a genuine alternative.  In general, the use of a contrast or covariation test is the best predictor of ability to distinguish between two explanations.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Reindeer Nutrition and Pasture Analysis in the Mongolian Taiga</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Flenniken, Meagan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The research for this thesis has taken place over the last two years (2005-2006) in the northern-most pinnacle of Mongolia only miles from the Russian border. It is aimed at assessing nutritional availability, range quality and utilization by domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in a small sliver of taiga ecosystem inhabited by a nomad reindeer-herding people called the Tsaatan. Indigenous reindeer herding practices and cultural strategies link the survivability of the people with the survivability of their reindeer.&#xd;
&#xd;
The period of Soviet occupation in Mongolia from 1921 to 1991 caused massive damage to the social fabric of Tsaatan culture and also herd health. Since 1991, the Tsaatan have been attempting to revive their culture in post-soviet, Mongolian democracy. Through dairy, packing, riding, meat and other by-products, reindeer provide the raw materials and power the Tsaatan need to survive in this cold mountainous region of Mongolia.&#xd;
&#xd;
Though a multitude of health problems effect the herd today including inbreeding and zoonotic diseases such as Brucellosis, I believe the herd?s recovery is predicated on first establishing better herd nutrition. Herd demographic data collected by myself and other researchers in 2006 showed a correlation between herd body condition and management strategies/forage quality [Appendix 1]. With the underlying assumption that heard health is influenced by nutrition, this study set out to collect the first set of data on forage availability/quality in Tsaatan pastures. My hypothesis was that both availability and diet composition vary from other reindeer groups and warrant a dynamic set of considerations in terms of best-management policies for the herd.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Effects of Concentrate Addition on In Vitro Rumen Fluid pH and Forage Fiber Digestion</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Reed, Kristan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Further characterization rumen digestion could aid in development of a more efficient diet. The objective was to determine the early effects (0-6h) of concentrate type on rumen pH and forage digestion. Two forages, orchard grass and corn (Zea mays L.) stover, were combined in a 50:50 ratio with 5 concentrate treatments (no concentrate, corn meal, corn gluten meal, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)  and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)). Samples were incubated in vitro in a 1:4 buffer to rumen fluid mixture for 420 min. The pH was measured at intervals throughout the trial and samples were collected for volatile fatty acid (VFA) analysis.  Forage samples alone had significantly lower pH (P&lt;0.05) than those samples containing concentrate. For corn stover samples, this correlates with a high mean lactic acid concentration (535 ppm). The final study measured change in pH and the difference in neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility of four concentrate treatments (no concentrate, corn meal, corn gluten meal, and barley). Two sample distribution methods were tested; forage and concentrate were mixed together in the same filter bag or separated into individual bags.  Barley had the largest inhibitory effect on fiber digestion and caused the largest decline in pH. Treatments with feeds in the same bag showed larger differences in pH and digestibility. Results suggest a diet containing a mixture of forages or, a mixture of corn and forage minimizes declines in rumen pH. They also suggest the study of associative effects is impeded by separation of feeds through filter bags.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Comparison of Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns Between Salmonella Enterica Subsp. Enterica and Escherichia Coli in Dairy Calves</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Abramson, Alexandra</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The primary objective of this study was to compare antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella enterica with Escherichia coli isolated from the same dairy calves. Fecal samples were collected from February 2004 to September 2005 from 74 calves. Calves with at least one Salmonella isolate and one E.coli isolate were included in our analysis. The 148 isolates collected from the 74 calves were tested using a broth tube dilution method for determining resistance to several antimicrobial agents (n=14): AMP, APR, CEF, CHL, ENR, FLO, GEN, NEO, OXY, SPE, SCH, SDI, STH, and TRI. Considering resistance to individual drugs, the percent of E.coli isolates with resistance was over 50 for 11 drugs and the percent of Salmonella isolates resistant was over 50 for 9 drugs. From the antimicrobial resistance patterns generated for E.coli (n=42) and Salmonella (n= 22), the bacteria were found to have 6 identical patterns in common. From these 6 patterns the most common pattern showed resistance to AMP, CEF, CHL, FLO, NEO, OXY, SCH, SDI, and STH. The association of antimicrobial resistance between Salmonella and E.coli for the same calves for individual antimicrobial agents proved not statistically significant. This study showed that resistance to drug classes important in human and animal medicine was common in Salmonella and E.coli from clinically ill calves. Overall, E.coli isolates were more resistant than Salmonella. While there were shared patterns of resistance (n=6) between Salmonella and E.coli, Salmonella isolates were not significantly more likely to be resistant to individual antibiotics if a calf had a resistant E.coli. Results suggest that selection pressure from recent exposure to drugs or interspecific gene transfer was not resulting in a strong association of resistance between the bacteria.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Effect of Changes in Weaning Age on Carcass Traits in Forage Finished Beef Cattle</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Corrado, Christopher</dc:creator>
<dc:description>An increase in percent intramuscular fat (%IMF) and average daily gain (ADG) are advantageous to the profitability and consumer palatability of forage finished beef.  The effects of weaning age in beef cattle fed an all forage diet on measure of weight gain and carcass quality were analyzed over two years of calf data.  Measures of gain included average daily gain, weight per day of age (WDA), and weight at the conclusion of trial two weaning (CW2).  Measures of carcass quality included  percent intramuscular fat, Longissimus muscle area (REA), rib fat (BF), finished live-weight (FW), rump fat (RF) at the conclusion of trial two weaning, empty body fat (EBF) and Longissimus muscle area as a function of finished weight (REA/FW). Angus x Simmental beef calves (N=50 over two years) were weaned at two distinct ages. In both trials, calves were weaned using a calf-weaner, a plastic removable nose ring used for low stress weaning.  In trial one calves were weaned at the time normally practiced, approximately 157 (+13) days of age in 2004 and 182.7 (+ 9.7) days of age in 2005. In trial two the time of weaning was delayed to 338.5 (+ 13.6) days of age in 2004 and 266.1 (+ 8.4) days of age in 2005.  Following weaning in both trails, calves were fed an all forage diet. For calves born in 2004, carcass data for both weaning groups was gathered by ultrasound at 597(+ 13.6) days of age; in 2005, calves from both trails were analyzed by ultrasound at approximately 554(+ 8.9) days of age. The calves in which weaning was delayed showed numerically higher values for percent intramuscular fat, rib eye area, rump fat, back fat, finished weight, weight per day of age, empty body fat (percent), and rib eye area as a function of finished weight. These differences however were generally not statistically significant using the general linear model in SAS (1998), and analyzing least square means using The Waller-Duncan K-ratio t test.  There was a statistically significant difference in WDA and CW2 for 2005 born calves.   The results of this research potentially show a relationship between delaying weaning and an increase in the carcass quality of forage finished beef.  As farmers producing forage finished beef seek to compete for market share in a market primarily dominated by grain finished, highly marbled, younger carcasses, a delay in weaning age may produce carcasses which are more highly competitive in the current market and capable of better suiting consumer preferences.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Maturity of the Lamb Immune System</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gailor, Mabel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Vaccines targeting specific threats to lamb health could be immensely instrumental in curbing high levels of lamb mortality in the U.S. lamb industry. However, the age at which vaccine administration would be most beneficial is currently unspecified due to limited knowledge of when lambs become immunocompetent. This study?s main objective was to determine the effect of age on the immunological competency of sheep in order to determine the optimal schedule for vaccinating lambs. An experiment was designed to examine the ability of lambs of varying ages to mount an antigen-specific immune response against Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) after vaccination with KLH in 10% aluminum hydroxide as the adjuvant. Groups of five lambs were vaccinated subcutaneously with one of three treatments (vaccine, control, adjuvant only) three times at two week intervals over a total of six weeks. The age at administration of the treatment was also variable (n=5); the lambs were either 0, 5, or 40 weeks of age at the start of their respective six week vaccine trial. Three blood samples were taken immediately prior to the second and third treatment and two weeks after the third. Lymphocyte proliferation, and production of total immunoglobulin (Ig), and KLH-specific Ig were measured. An increase in lymphocyte production in vaccinated animals in response to vaccines was seen as early as 4 weeks of age, after two vaccines. The production of anti-KLH Ab in vaccinated lambs began after the first vaccination and had a fold response four times as high as control and adjuvant-only animals when sampled two weeks after the first vaccination.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Effects of Age, Dominance, and Mating System on Vocal Consistency in Mockingbirds (Aves: Mimidae)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rossman, Rachel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>While many studies have looked at selection for large repertoire sizes in birds, few have explored the potential for selection on the ability to sing each type in the repertoire consistently.  I explored this issue by studying the consistency with which two closely related species of mockingbirds, i.e. the northern (Mimus polyglottos) and the tropical mockingbird (M. gilvus), repeated each syllable type. I hypothesized that if there is selection for singing ability and not just for an increase in repertoire size, it could be expected that syllable consistency should be (1) higher in older, more experienced individuals, (2) higher in species with higher potential for sexual selection via female choice (i.e. higher in the northern versus the tropical mockingbird) and (3) higher in males expected to be of higher quality (i.e. in dominant versus subordinate birds). I found that song consistency could be improved with practice because tropical mockingbirds became more consistent with age. When comparing across male types, I found that consistency was higher in northern and dominant tropical mockingbirds than in subordinate tropical mockingbirds (although the data suggests that dominant tropical mockingbirds that compete with subordinates for breeding may not be much better singers than these subordinates). I suggest that the lack of significant differences between northern mockingbirds and dominant tropical mockingbirds could be a product of a trade-off between repertoire size and singing consistency because as the number of types in a repertoire increases, the opportunities to practice each type are reduced.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Investigations into Colony Identity in a Social Spider: Does Delena cancerides Utilize Chemical Cues to Distinguish Between Kin and Non-kin?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Avery, Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The presence of recognition systems, though oft-studied and well documented in the eusocial insects, has been largely unreported among the spiders.  Most spider species are solitary and cannibalistic, such that kin recognition is not particularly advantageous, and most social spiders do not apparently differentiate between relatives and non-relatives.  However, Delena cancerides, a social huntsman spider from southern Australia, is the only social spider known to respond aggressively to introduced non-relatives and has been shown to preferentially consume non-kin in starvation experiments.  It is hypothesized that chemical cues mediate the differentiation of related colony mates from non-colony mates, and that D. cancerides prefer exposure to cues derived from their natal colony to those derived from an alien colony.  I used a three choice olfactometer to implement an olfactory preference assay with D. cancerides, using the degree of exploration in the olfactometer to divide trials into three analyzable groups.  Movement within the olfactometer during trials was highly non-random.  Spiders in the group characterized by exploration of both the same-colony and foreign-colony stimuli settled with their same-colony stimulus at the end of the trial significantly more than predicted by chance.  However, none of the three trial groups spent significantly more time in the presence of a same-colony stimulus than predicted by random motion.  Spiders spent significantly more time in the presence of conspecific stimuli, from either same- or foreign-colonies, than predicted by random motion in two of three trial groups, suggesting that recognition of conspecifics and the tendency to aggregate is also mediated chemically.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Schildia Aldrich, 1923, a distinctive and rare genus of Leptogastrinae (Diptera: Asilidae), is revised. Twelve species are recognized, of which five are new to science. The nine extant species are Neotropical, Afrotropical, and Oriental in distribution. The extant Neotropical species are S. alphus Martin, 1975; S. caliginosa sp. n., described from southern Venezuela; S. fragilis (Carerra, 1944); S. guatemalae Martin, 1975; S. gracillima (Walker, 1855); S. jamaicensis Farr, 1963; S. microthorax Aldrich, 1923; and S. zonae Martin, 1975. S. ocellata Martin, 1975 is synonymized with S. gracillima. The extant Afrotropical species is S. adina sp. n., described from extant and copal (0-11000 years ago) specimens from Madagascar. The extant Oriental species is S. malaya sp. n., described from Kedah, Malaysia. Two extinct species, S. angustifrons and S. martini, are newly described from Dominican amber (15-20 million years ago). Redescriptions and descriptions of the genus and all extant and fossil species are provided. An identification key to the extant and fossil species is presented. Illustrations, photographs, and scanning electron micrographs are provided to support the descriptions and key. Distribution, biogeography, occurrence in biodiversity hotspots, seasonal incidence, and biology are discussed. The geographic distributions of several species are expanded. Potential reasons are explored to explain why Schildia, previously thought to be strictly Neotropical, is also found in Madagascar and Malaysia. Tentative minimum age of the genus is discussed in light of new fossil and biogeographical data.</dc:description>

<dc:title>A Multi-faceted Analysis of Spinosad Resistance in the House Fly (Musca domestica L.)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Deacutis, Juliane</dc:creator>
<dc:description>House flies are important vectors of a number of animal and human pathogens, thus controlling them is of great importance.  Commercial insecticide control of house flies is limited to a few chemicals, and the development of resistance to these chemicals is an ongoing concern.  Therefore, finding new effective insecticides is critical.  &#xd;
Spinosad is a relatively new promising insecticide that was released in 2005 for house fly control.  It is derived from the bacterium Saccharopolyspora spinosa.  It is highly effective against pest species and is thought to have a unique mode of action.  A resistant laboratory house fly strain was developed and studies indicate the resistance mechanism is unique, recessive, and located on autosome 1.  &#xd;
Although house fly resistance to spinosad has been developed in the laboratory, resistance in field populations has not been characterized.  In this study I monitored spinosad resistance at several dairy, hog and poultry farms over the summers of 2004 and 2005.  Results showed that there was a variation in baseline susceptibility between different field sites, but no development of resistance was observed.  Due to limitations of insecticide bioassays, developing a more sensitive resistance detection method and identifying the gene responsible for resistance will be important for future monitoring programs.&#xd;
As part of an important step in determining the gene for resistance, I linked a number of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits to a particular house fly autosome.  Spinosad toxicity is due to interactions with nAChRs and is associated with autosome 1.  Of the four genes analyzed, two (Md?5 and Md?6) were associated with autosome 1, one (Md?2) was associated with autosome 2, and one gene association (Md?3) was not determined.  &#xd;
Lastly, I assessed the fitness effects of spinosad resistance on mating competition.  I found that a laboratory susceptible strain had a mating advantage over a laboratory spinosad resistant strain.</dc:description>

<dc:title>A Survey of the Dung Beetles in Cattle Manure on Pastures of an Organic and a Conventional Dairy Farm in New York State</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pimsler, Meaghan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Dairy is an important part of New York state agriculture. Many dung beetle species live in pasture cattle manure.  This study was a survey of the species of beetles (Scarabaeidae, Geotrupidae, Hydrophilidae, and Histeridae) in dairy cattle manure from pastures of two different farms, one conventional and one organic.  Aphodius species, specifically A. granarius, A. haemorrhoidalis, and A. stercorus were the most numerous beetles (approximately 21% of the identified beetles), excluding the small, unidentified Hydrophilidae less than 2 mm in length.  This contrasts with results of similar studies using the same protocol in North Carolina where Onthophagus taurus was the most abundant species of dung beetle on pastures, suggesting that latitude has a an effect on the composition of dung beetle communities.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Shooting Blanks: Mate Choice and Determination in a Parasitically Castrated Snail, Littorina littorea</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zimmerman, Ariel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The trematode parasite Cryptocotyle lingua completely castrates both male and female Littorina littorea snails that it infects. Selection should favor males who distinguish between fertile and parasitically-castrated females when choosing mates. I addressed this question by sampling mating pairs in the intertidal and those snails in their immediate vicinity. I compared the frequency of infection in females in mating pairs with that of ambient non-mating females to determine if the frequency of infection was significantly lower in mating females. In addition, to test the assumption that infected males were physiologically incapable of initiating copulatory behavior, I compared the infection prevalence of mating males with that of non-mating ambient males. I found that there was no significant difference in the infection prevalence between mating and non-mating females, indicating that males were not distinguishing between infected and uninfected females.  This may be the case due to high levels of gene flow between highly infected and unexposed populations, insignificant costs associated with wasted mating attempts for males, or low heritability of the means for detecting infection in females.  Infection prevalence in mating males was nearly significantly lower than that of non-mating males. However, the surprising frequency of infected males mating (15%) suggests that gonad health is not a pre-requisite for initiating copulatory behavior.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Assessing the Costs of Group Living: Comparing Metabolic Physiology and Growth in Social and Solitary Spiders</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zimmerman, Ariel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sociality in arachnids is extremely rare though well documented for the few cases that exist. However, no research to date has examined the metabolic and growth characteristics associated with social behavior. Delena cancerides is a social huntsman spider that closely overlaps in distribution with several closely related species of solitary huntsmen, providing a unique opportunity for comparison. I compared the metabolic rate of D. cancerides to other species of solitary huntsman using a closed-system respirometer. I also compared the growth, survival and molting frequency of D. cancerides spiderlings in solo and group treatments to those of solitary huntsman species. Delena cancerides had a significantly lower mass-specific metabolic rate than all other species to which it was compared. This is explained in the context of reduced food availability per individual for prolonged periods of time due to sharing. Delena cancerides spiderlings did not differ from other species when housed alone, but grew significantly more in group environments than did solitary species. Mortality was lowest for D. cancerides living in groups than for any other species living in groups. There was no difference for any species in molting patterns between solo and group treatments. D. cancerides molted consistently earlier and more often than the species to which it was compared. The consequences of these findings are discussed in the context of prey-sharing and avoidance of cannibalism.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Understanding the Role of Human Dynamics in the Practices of Cleveland Area Landscape Architectural Firms</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jakse, Sonia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis aims to discover, understand, and evaluate the contemporary client and user involvement practices of landscape architects in the Greater Cleveland area.  The research used narrative interviews with firms and their clients to answer the following questions:&#xd;
&#xd;
1.	Do landscape architects correctly interpret their clients? needs?&#xd;
2.	Are clients? needs incorporated into designs? &#xd;
3.	Are clients satisfied with landscape architectural services? &#xd;
4.	Do landscape architects involve users on a regular basis?&#xd;
5.	Is there a set of best practices to adopt when working with clients? &#xd;
&#xd;
The results showed that landscape architects focused on understanding the needs of their clients from the beginning of the design process through one-on-one communication with them.  This input was incorporated into designs to the satisfaction of the clients.  Landscape architects felt that part of their job was to educate clients about good design.  This allows their practical and creative input to combine with the client?s producing a design that satisfies their needs and holds up over time.  Clients appreciate the practical recommendations and high level of communication that the landscape architects offer.&#xd;
&#xd;
Users do not participate in the design process on a day-to-day basis, although most firms work with them sporadically.  The methods for working with them are not well defined by the interviewees.&#xd;
&#xd;
Both client and user involvement is limited by budget constraints, project type, and client wishes.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Landscape Symbolism of Imperial Rome: Reflecting the Governmental Changes from the Republic to the Empire</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tuccio, Christopher</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This work presents research on the symbolic intent of public space in Rome during the fall of the Republic, (61 ? 2 BC). The thesis focuses particularly on the three largest public developments occurring during this time period: the Theatre Complex of Pompey, the Forum of Caesar, and the Forum of Augustus. The political organization of Rome was changing during this time period, slowly transitioning from a representative democracy to an imperial dictatorship. Certain elements of the three public spaces that were created at this time symbolize these political transformations. Providing detailed design analysis of these areas will help in understanding the use of symbolic attributes of the public landscape. The specific elements to be studied are: location, orientation, axes, and scale.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Formative Evaluation of Massachusetts Audubon Society?s Coastal Waterbird Program</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bell, Caitlin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>I conducted a formative evaluation of the Massachusetts Audubon Society?s Coastal Waterbird Program (CWP).  Specifically, I used document analyses, interviews, and a mail census of CWP staff to assess the appropriateness and adequacy of CWP design and implementation actions.  I identified that the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) could be used as an appropriate social science foundation to improve the program design and the identification of additional implementation actions.  Most implementation actions seemed to focus on the monitoring of nest success and fledging rate of protected bird species that nest on beaches and reacting to public behaviors that are disturbing to these birds.  According to TPB, additional benefits likely could be achieved by developing implementation actions focused on proactively engaging the public to prevent disturbing behaviors before they occur.  Survey results indicated that field staff already engage in proactive actions despite not being trained extensively to do so.  In addition, staff held substantially more positive evaluative beliefs about proactive interactions than reactive interactions.  Rather than identifying problems confronting the CWP, these results identify opportunities that can be built on to improve the program.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Retention of logging debris to reduce deer browsing and promote forest regeneration</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hunn, Joshua</dc:creator>
<dc:description>One of the most important species in northeastern forest ecosystems is the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus).  Browsing by these herbivores can influence patterns of forest regeneration following a timber harvest.  Logging debris, or ?slash?, has the potential to inhibit deer browsing and enhance forest regeneration in a cutover area.  At two heavily logged sites in the Arnot Forest, NY, study plots containing experimental seedlings and natural vegetation were created in May 2004 and monitored thru November 2006.  Each plot received one of three treatments: open - cleared of logging debris; tops ? tree tops and debris-covered; or fenced - cleared of debris and fenced to exclude deer.  Levels of deer browsing in experimental seedlings and natural vegetation, tree seedling growth, and natural vegetation richness, were compared among these treatments.  We found significantly higher deer browsing on experimental seedlings (p = .0053) and palatable herbaceous vegetation (p = .0094) in open plots, than tops-covered or fenced plots.  Cumulative deer browsing negatively correlated with mean experimental seedling height at the plot level (p = .0296), resulting in higher black cherry (Prunus serotina) seedling growth in protected fenced and tops treatments.  Additionally, logging debris was found to benefit common management objectives, such as herb richness and relative abundance of desirable timber tree seedlings. We conclude that logging debris left in place after a forest thinning can effectively inhibit deer browsing and promote forest regeneration. The degree of protection afforded by tree tops was intermediate between unprotected and fenced areas.  The minimal effort and cost associated with this technique would make it highly preferable to constructing fences to improve regeneration. As white-tailed deer become increasingly overabundant, alternative options for the sustainable regeneration of forests are necessary; the post-harvest retention of logging debris in situ provides such an alternative.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Macroinvertebrate colonization of invasive Fallopia x bohemica leaf litter in a temperate stream</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kates, Norah</dc:creator>
<dc:description>We compared macroinvertebrate communities on leaf packs made of recently senesced leaves of native Quercus and Acer, and invasive Fallopia x bohemica.  Leaf packs were left in Cascadilla Creek, a third-order temperate stream in central New York, U.S.A., for 7, 14, 28, or 56 days.  After we removed them from the stream, we examined the leaf packs for biomass loss and invertebrate richness and abundance.  While we expected to see a significant difference between leaf types, which would indicate a cascade effect of invasive vegetation on higher trophic levels, little variation was actually seen.  The results of this study suggest that localized effects of F. x bohemica on invertebrate communities in streams are quite small if the invasive component represents only a small percentage of the total biomass of the system.  Leaf breakdown rates also did not differ significantly between the invasive and either of the two native leaf types.  We observed larger numbers of predators on leaves of F. x bohemica than on either of the native leaf types, which may impact leaf breakdown and consumer activity over a longer study period, but what we have seen so far is still inconclusive.  Further study will have to better simulate true invasion conditions where native vegetation is not available to invertebrate communities, and incorporate a full season of leaf breakdown.</dc:description>

<dc:title>William J. Hamilton, Jr. of Cornell, The Man and the Myth</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Margulies, Elan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>William J. Hamilton, Jr. was a prominent Professor of Mammalogy who was beloved by his students and peers.   Bill entered Cornell as an undergraduate in 1920 and stayed until his death in 1990. Professor Hamilton helped found the Department of Conservation in 1947, which was the precursor to the Department of Natural Resources.  During his 33 years as a professor, he directed 60 graduate students and was on the thesis committee of 150. Bill was a meticulous note taker, and encouraged his students to do the same.  He was a great naturalist whose specialty in mammalogy only exceeded his knowledge in other fields of natural history.  Throughout his life he supported the study of ?Backyard Biology? ? the belief that scientific wonders could be discovered at your own doorstep. He was an avid gardener who introduced many garden species to New York State.  ?Wild Bill?, as he was known, was famous for his tall tales and practical jokes.  Oftentimes, this jesting was focused on teaching his students a lesson, or exposing the faults in that person?s knowledge.  His academic honors included publishing over 230 scholarly articles, serving as the president of the American Society of Mammalogists and as the president of the Ecological Society of America.  His textbook, Mammals of Eastern North America, became the textbook of choice for decades and to this day has remained a critical resource for students.  Through personal interviews, archival research and contact with the Hamilton family, the author has created an abbreviated biography.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The role of pre-mastication in the evolution of complementary feeding strategies: a bio-cultural analysis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zhang, Yuanyuan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Human milk is a poor source of iron. At birth, the newborn is well endowed with iron stores, which are adequate to meet his/her needs for the first 4-6 months of infancy (WHO March 2001), and iron deficiency is rare. On the other hand, iron deficiency is prevalent among infants between 6- 12 months of age, particularly in developing countries, and iron supplementation during breastfeeding, and thereafter, is recommended, in addition to 6 months exclusive breastfeeding (WHO, 2002). If exclusively breastfed infants are becoming anemic by the time complementary foods are first being introduced, this raises a challenge to our assumptions about the nature of human bio-cultural evolution. Is the anemia of infancy normal or did usual feeding practices prevent it? As iron supplementation was not possible until recently, I hypothesized that exclusive breastfeeding was complemented by premasticated foods during our evolution as a hunting-gathering species. In other words, that iron deficiency in infancy is a recent problem in human society, which was previously prevented by premastication. &#xd;
&#xd;
 The goals of this research were to assess the prevalence of premastication in non-modern societies in order to determine whether (1) it was prevalent enough to support plausibly its role as a behavioral adaptation to prevent iron deficiency and  (2) to determine whether the potentially detrimental effects of premasticated food were harmful enough to be selected against. This research involves several lines of investigation: 1) bringing together the evidence that iron deficiency is a common problem, which is now found in many different regions of the world, 2) a cross-cultural study, using the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) to obtain ethnographic data on the distribution and time depth of premastication in human societies, 3) a field research study in China, based on interviews conducted by University students, to examine the potential for serious under-reporting of pre-mastication in the ethnographic studies, 4)  a review of the iron content of foods that are reported to be premasticated, and  5) a review of the scientific literature on the content of saliva. &#xd;
&#xd;
In the HRAF analysis, 39 cultures out of 119 cultures (33%) that contain any information on infant feeding describe premastication as an infant feeding practice. Notably none of the ethnographies from China mention premastication. However, the field survey in China, with a sample of 104 elite college students, found that 63%  (65 of 104) were fed pre-masticated food when they were infants, and those who received premasticated foods were more likely to be fed complementary foods earlier than those who did not. The survey findings support the notion that premastication tends to be under-reported in ethnographic studies. Although salvia has not been as extensively studied as breastmilk, the review of the biomedical literature suggests that it contains several potential positive substances from the perspective of infant health and fewer negative substances than are commonly assumed. &#xd;
&#xd;
The results of the various lines of investigation suggest that pre-mastication has been a common practice in human societies, but has been significantly under-reported. &#xd;
The potential dangers of increased infection that pre-mastication poses for infant health  &#xd;
have probably been less serious  than the disadvantages of not engaging in pre-mastication, which is a means of giving infants iron to prevent deficiency as stores begin to drop during the first semester of life. Therefore I conclude it is probable that pre-mastication was the behavior/cultural solution to the complementary feeding challenge in human societies, that it probably prevented the level of iron deficiency, which is common today in poor societies.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Development and Characterization of a Novel Concentrated Milk Product Using Membrane Filtration Technology</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fan, Elaine</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In recent years microfiltration (MF) technology has gained prominence in dairy industry due to its ability to separate virtually every major component in milk without causing major damages to its properties.  Current shelf-stable concentrated dairy products often have brown off-colors and ?cooked? off-flavors due to heat-induced Maillard browning and whey protein denaturation that occur during sterilization.  &#xd;
&#xd;
MF was used in this study to develop a novel concentrated milk product depleted of most of its lactose (to limit Maillard browning) and whey proteins.  Acidified skim milk was concentrated to 8x microfiltration concentration factor and then diluted 1:1 with distilled water and sterilized in cans to produce a microfiltered milk concentrate (MMC). &#xd;
&#xd;
The MMC was characterized by its chemical composition, color, apparent viscosity, flow behavior, and storage potential.  Furthermore, these characteristics of the MMC were compared with a concentrated dairy product, commercial evaporated milk (CEM).&#xd;
&#xd;
The % (w/w) composition of the MMC was found to be 20.6% total solids, 13.4% true protein, 12.0% casein, 0.6% fat, 1.5% ash, 1.8% lactose and 0.7% whey proteins.  It was comparable to CEM in total solids, greater in true protein, casein, and fat, and lower in ash, lactose and whey proteins.  The MMC retained much more of the white color of HTST-pasteurized milk than the CEM.  The apparent viscosity (~9.5 cP at 30?C) of the MMC was much greater than that of the CEM and the MMC was seen to be more &#xd;
pseudoplastic in nature (n &lt; 1) than the CEM.  The changes during 12-month storage were comparable between the CEM and MMC samples.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Molecular Evolution of the prfA Cluster in Listeria monocytogenes Lineage III Isolates</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Maron, Steven</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Listeria monocytogenes lineage III represents a diverse subset that is generally associated with non-human mammalian infection, although some isolates are capable of infecting humans. A cluster of virulence genes (prfA, plcA, hly, mpl, actA, and plcB), known as the prfA cluster, was sequenced in eleven lineage III isolates from food, animal, and human clinical cases, and analyzed in conjunction with forty previously sequenced isolates from lineages I (n = 18), II (n = 21), and III (n = 1). The lineage III isolates represent three previously identified lineage III subsets known as lineage IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC. &#xd;
&#xd;
Evolutionary analysis identified intragenic positive selection in actA and plcA, and intergenic positive selection in the non-coding regions flanking hly. Positive selection in actA occurred in many positions previously recognized for their interactions with proteins involved in actin tail polymerization. Also, one positively selected site upstream of hly was located in its -35 promoter region. Additionally, horizontal gene transfer was recognized in actA, plcB, and mpl. The majority of events involved actA fragments transferred between lineages IIIA and II. Lineage IIIB did not partipate in any inter-lineage recombination events, but may have donated an mpl fragment to lineage IIIC. Neighbor joining phylogenies suggest that lineage III subsets IIIA and IIIC are monophyletic with lineage I, but that lineage IIIB is not. Therefore, due to its lack of horizontal gene transfer, and distant phylogenetic relationship to the rest of L. monocytogenes, lineage IIIB may represent a distinct subspecies.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Snow Distribution Patterns at Land Cover Boundaries in Tompkins County, NY</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McPhillips, Lauren</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Since humans first began clearing land for agriculture, rural landscapes have become a complex mosaic of forests and fields. During winter, the borders between these two land use types become especially interesting as winds moving across fields entrain fallen snow and may redistribute it to the forest edge. Since snow depth can have serious implications for soil conditions and biogeochemical processes, I proposed to evaluate snow distribution at field- forest boundaries in Tompkins County, NY through a combination of techniques that address the degree of snow redistribution at a variety of scales.  Continuous measures using time-lapse photographs taken along a field border from January to March 2007 were used to assess localized redistribution over a snow period. These observations revealed snow accumulation at the field-forest border particularly in areas where the grass in the field had been mowed. Manual measurements of snow depth across several field- forest borders throughout the county were used to estimate how much snow was redistributed to borders, on average, in the county. These data demonstrated that there are a number of factors affecting the extent of snow redistribution from fields to forest borders, but the phenomenon definitely exists. A rough extrapolation of our results suggests that 1.9% of Tompkins County?s snow accumulates at these boundaries (which comprise 1.3% of the county?s area).  With the increasing fragmentation of landscapes, it is integral to understand physical processes such as snow drifting at forest edges so that we can then better comprehend the ecological implications of such occurrences.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Local Minimum of Tropical Cyclogenesis in the Eastern Caribbean</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Shieh, Owen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The study has determined that a local, climatological minimum of tropical cyclogenesis exists over the eastern Caribbean Sea.  This area, known colloquially by forecasters as the ?hurricane graveyard,? is located within the belt of tropical easterlies during most of the Atlantic hurricane season, which lasts from June through November.  Tropical easterly waves emerging from the African continent usually follow a path through the Lesser Antilles and into the eastern Caribbean.  GOES infrared satellite imagery shows that easterly waves frequently exhibit warming cloud tops and decreasing convection in an area bounded by the islands to the north and east, Venezuela to the south, and roughly 75 degrees longitude to the west.  QuikSCAT derived surface winds during clear-sky conditions frequently show the presence of accelerating easterlies in the central Caribbean as part of the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ).  Analysis of the NCEP global reanalysis wind fields suggests the presence of an area of persistent low-level mass divergence in the eastern Caribbean.  This implies a subsident regime that would weaken convection.  Climatologically, this phenomenon reaches peak intensity in July, then shifts towards the east and weakens in the latter half of the Atlantic hurricane season.  This is reflected by the local minimum of tropical cyclogenesis points in the National Hurricane Center?s best track data in the early part of the season.  El Ni?o directly affects the strength of the CLLJ, and hence, is related to the intensity of the low-level divergence in the eastern Caribbean.  The local minimum of tropical cyclogenesis in this region has important implications to operational forecasting, since the vast majority of tropical cyclones in the Caribbean eventually affect surrounding landmasses.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study examines the importance of intercultural communication for career development in two segments of the hospitality industry, cruise and hotel.  Three topics are explored: (1) the perceived relative importance of intercultural communication skills for career development, (2) whether differences exist between native and non-native English speakers in the importance assigned to intercultural communication, and (3) whether differences exist between cruise and hotel managers regarding the extent to which intercultural communication is perceived as important to career development.&#xd;
The sample for the original study consisted of 77 cruise ship directors and 111 hotel general managers.  All 188 participants completed a Likert-style questionnaire.  The questionnaire was designed to collect information on the personal characteristics and skills perceived to be critical to managers? career development in the hotel or cruise industry.  Demographic information was also collected.  Descriptive statistics, Pearson Product Moment Correlations, Independent Samples t Tests, and content analysis were conducted.  Analyses indicated that the respondents perceive intercultural communication to be moderately important in the hospitality industry, that non-native English speakers perceive intercultural communication skills as more important to career development than native English-speakers, and that cruise ship directors perceive intercultural communication skills as more important for career success than hotel general managers.  In addition, the results suggest a need for hospitality practitioners to improve upon and hospitality educators to teach intercultural communication skills to facilitate the career development of hospitality managers.  Future directions for research are also suggested.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper we describe an experiment comparing the production of lies in first encounters that took place face-to-face (FTF) or in computer-mediated communication (CMC: instant-messaging). Participants reviewed their conversations and retrospectively identified deceptive statements. While the overall incidence of lying did not differ across conditions, the rate of deception per information exchanged was significantly higher in CMC. The characteristics of the lies suggest that the content and severity of lies do not vary substantially across media.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Social Support and Family Status as Influences on Perceptions of Health Risks and Information-Seeking Behavior: A Case of New York State Teachers</dc:title>

<dc:description>Numerous studies have indicated the importance of social support to health; those who are less socially integrated are psychologically and physically less healthy, and have higher mortality rates.  A primary social support system is the family, which may be further characterized by the marital relationship and the parental relationship.  This study examines one mechanism by which the influence family status, social networks and social integration may alter the perception of risks and information-seeking behaviors.  If individuals are more sensitive to possible health risks as a result of social linkages, they may follow that increased concern with information seeking, and eventually risk protective behaviors.&#xd;
In recent years, a number of national and international research projects have documented the increased incidence of breast cancer among teachers (1.5 times higher).  In response, Cornell University and the National Education Association conducted a regional study of New York State teachers and educational support professionals to investigate their knowledge and perceptions of breast cancer risk factors (N=1114).  &#xd;
	The study found mixed support for the hypothesis that family status, social networks and social integration influence risk perceptions and information-seeking behaviors.  Most prominently, however, is that communication about health issues among members within a social network, community participation and general participation activities are significant predictors of increased risk perception, health concerns in the school and the community, and health information-seeking behaviors.  These findings suggest that there is a need to build into breast cancer risk communication efforts in understanding an individual?s perceptions and information-seeking behaviors.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Individual differences in irony production and use</dc:title>

<dc:description>What factors affect the way an individual processes and uses irony? The present research investigates whether cognitive flexibility, conversational indirectness, and personality traits may account for the differences in an individual?s use of irony. The results of this study suggest that cognitive flexibility and personality traits predict irony use. An individual who is cognitively flexible is more likely to use irony and better at interpreting it because he/she can process the multiple interpretations presented by ironic language. Agreeable and conscientious people are less likely to use irony because of their innate personality traits and the harsh, critical nature of ironic language. These results suggest that agreeableness and conscientiousness are personality traits that determine which type of sarcasm an individual may use in daily interactions, while cognitive flexibility seems important to situational forms of irony. These individual differences support a view of irony as cognitively complex and interpersonally critical.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Stereotypes are constantly utilized to draw inferences and evaluate information, regardless of whether or not individuals employing them are cognizant of this fact. However, when jurors who are responsible for evaluating the truthfulness and credibility of witness testimony rely on stereotypes regarding the emotional responses of men and women to judge witness testimony, the conclusions they draw may be tainted. In this study, six experimental conditions were constructed to ascertain whether witness testimony would produce different effects if male and female witnesses delivered testimony while showing emotions stereotypical of their genders or emotions unexpected of their genders. While testifying that they were the victims of an armed robbery, male and female witnesses showed fear, anger, or no emotion. It was found that when male witnesses displayed the stereotypical emotion for their gender, anger, the participants rated the guilt of the defendants significantly higher than when female witnesses displayed the same emotion. Conversely, when female witnesses displayed the emotion stereotypical for their gender, fear, the participants rated the guilt of defendants significantly higher than when men displayed fear. It was also found that female displays of anger and fear produced a much greater difference in guilt rating for defendants than male changes in emotion. Additionally, over all experimental conditions, witnesses were believed to be telling the truth most when they showed fear and least when they showed anger.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The Geographic Basis of Food Insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa</dc:title>

<dc:description>One out of every three people lacks access to sufficient nourishment in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the greatest food insecurity in the world today.  Low agricultural productivity and expansionary demographic trends will necessitate greater reliance on imports if the food needs of the region are to be met in the future.  However, sub-Saharan Africa is distant from major food export markets, and many of its countries are landlocked.  In my research, I quantify the influence of the region?s transport-prohibitive characteristics on food security. By constructing regression models from agricultural trade data, I demonstrate that geographically isolated countries face substantially higher grain import prices, and these higher prices can raise the prevalence of hunger.   I find that 300 kilometers between the port of disembarkation and the major population agglomeration in the importing country explains a one percentage point increase in the undernourished population.    This result highlights the needs for infrastructure investment and low trade barriers to minimize the cost of remoteness and promote the eradication of hunger in the region.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Television and other media influence expectations and perceptions of love and marriage. In this experiment, various gender behaviors of sex and relationships were shown in the context of romantic relationships on television. Participants? interest, character approval, and perceived realism were compared between expected and not-expected gender behavior for white and black television characters. The results indicate that, in general, characters are seen as less real, and receive lower approval ratings, when expected gender behavior is violated. However, male participants may have different perceptions regarding television characters than female participants due to the genre through which romantic relationships are shown on television. These findings contribute to previous research that preconceived gender expectations affect how we perceive and define gender roles in both television shows and reality.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Previous studies show that the degree to which an individual is transported into a narrative influences the way the story affects their attitudes and beliefs.  This study looks in particular at how individuals learn about animals through animal narratives.  We manipulated visualization, anthropomorphism, story type (fiction/non-fiction), and factuality to determine how these factors influence both transportation and learning.  Our findings determined that there was no significant influence of visualization on the degree of transportation experienced by participants (p>.05).  Results found that anthropomorphic stories were less transportive than non-anthropomorphic stories.  Data also concluded that participants more highly transported answer more questions correctly, implying a higher rate of learning.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the United States, the concept of quarterlife crisis is an increasingly recognized social phenomenon.  However, much about this dynamic period in the life course, and its impact on individuals remains undocumented.  For example, how does the quarterlife transition inform individuals? expectations about their future geographic mobility?  It is important to ascertain whether the quarterlife experience is salient across national boundaries, and whether it has a similar impact on the expectations of young adults in various cultural contexts.  Cross-cultural findings could yield valuable data for policy-makers or employers aiming to attract or retain young adults within a specific region.  To explore the universality of quarterlife transition, I compare the expected geographic mobility of college students preparing to graduate in two different regions: Flanders, Belgium, which is characterized by retention of young adults, and upstate New York, which has seen immense out-migration of young adults in recent decades.  Interviews conducted with graduating college students in both locales provide a foundation of qualitative data.  To understand the personal allegories and stories that individuals shared with me, I apply an analytical thematic framework rooted in sociological life-course theory.  Life-Span Development, Agency, Time and Place, Timing, Linked Lives comprise the five paradigmatic principles used to create a comparison of young adults in Flanders and upstate New York.  This rubric sheds lights on similarities as well as several important differences in how individuals experience the quarterlife transition in different regions and which factors inform their expectations about future geographic mobility.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>diffusion of prediabetes information</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Prediabetes is defined as a condition that develops when a patient?s blood sugar level falls between the normoglycemic and diabetic range.  Prior research suggests that the loss of ten percent of body mass in a pre-diabetic patient may eliminate or prolong the onset of diabetes.  However, a recent study conducted shows that physicians do not know how to diagnose prediabetes. This current investigation explores the spread of prediabetes information through the perspective of the diffusion of innovation theory.  Methods. A secondary analysis of the physician assessment on diabetes knowledge established the problem.  A follow-up survey was distributed to physicians to explore the effectiveness of communication sources.  Results. The presence of barriers to information is associated with less time researching a topic. The most frequently used medium is internet, and the more sources that are used when researching the topic is correlated to a higher perception of knowledge on prediabetes.  A physician will attend an information session run by a physician that he admires regardless of the topic. Conclusion. A secondary analysis established that physicians are not correctly diagnosing prediabetes.  The follow-up survey suggests confirmation of three hypotheses, hypotheses: (1) physicians are less likely to spend time researching a topic when a barrier is present, even if they perceive ease in accessing medical information, (2) physicians who use more information sources perceive that they are more informed, and that  the internet is the most effective medium when researching medical information, and (3) physicians are more likely to attend an information session run by a physician they admire, regardless of the topic.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Eating Restraint and Food Power as Predictors for Consumption and Freshman Weight Gain</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Giannopoulos, Georgia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between dietary restraint, consumption, and freshman weight gain.  It was hypothesized that restrained eaters are more responsive to environmental cues, will eat more when served more food, and will gain weight during their first semester at Cornell.  Fifty freshmen attended a session at the Human Metabolic Unit and answered two questionnaires:  The Eating Habits Questionnaire and Power Food Scale, and body weight was measured.  They were served an all-you-can-eat lunch of pasta, marinara sauce, salad, dressing, and soup.  Food intake was measured and recorded.  After two weeks, the subjects attended a restaurant-style lunch and were served 1.5 times what they ate at lunch one.  When subjects finished eating, they were offered an all-you-can-eat dessert of chocolate cake and ice cream.  Again food intake was measured and recorded.  Change in food intake across lunches was determined.  At the end of the semester, subjects were weighed again to determine body weight change.&#xd;
The evidence all in, the conclusion is inescapable:  restrained eaters are more responsive to environmental cues and have higher food power scores.  In this study, eating restraint was an accurate predictor of food intake and the more restrained eaters ate significantly more when served more food and when served dessert compared to less restrained eaters.  A significant freshman weight gain of approximately two pounds was also determined, but the association between restraint and weight gain was not significant.  This study should be tweaked and replicated so that the relationship between dietary restraint, consumption, and freshman weight gain can be understood.  With the appropriate data available, policy changes can be made to implement changes on college campuses that will help combat disordered eating patterns that are characteristic of restrained eaters.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Strain and Gender Differences in Expression of BK Potassium Channel Subunits in Mouse Adrenal Gland</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ahmed, Sameer</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sexual dimorphisms in adrenal function and distinct behavioral patterns of aggression and ?emotionality? in SJL and C57/BL6 mouse strains led to an intriguing question: are there strain- and/or gender-specific differences in the adrenal gland at the level of ion channels? In this study, we focused on the adrenal medulla, which is a critical component of the neuroendocrine system and responsible for modulating reactions to stress and regulation of various body processes including digestion, the immune system, mood, and energy usage. Secretion of epinephrine (EPI) from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla is tightly controlled by the electrophysiologial response generated from neural inputs. Several studies suggest that the intrinsic excitability of these cells is modulated by the number and kenetic properties of large-conductance calcium(2+)-activated potassium ion channels (BK channels). Therefore, we focused on BK channels to study strain- and gender-specific differences in the adrenal gland at the level of ion channels. Stress- and sex-steroids have been shown to regulate alternative splicing of the pore-forming subunit of BK channels (Slo-?) in several experimental contexts, and associated ?-subunits confer on BK channels distinct sensitivities to acute effects of stress- and sex-steroids. Using a real-time PCR technique, we examined mRNA levels for total Slo, STREX (a stress-regulated splice-variant of Slo), ?2, and ?4 in two mouse strains, SJL and C57/BL6. The experimental groups were: SJL males, SJL females, and C57/BL6 males. SJL males expressed significantly higher levels of mRNA for total Slo, ?2, and ?4 than SJL females and C57/BL6 males. STREX levels were not significantly different between the groups, probably due to a small sample size, but on average, SJL males had higher levels of expression than the other two groups. These results suggest that SJL females and C57/BL6 males are relatively similar in their BK channel expression in the adrenals, while SJL males show distinct expression patterns. From this study, we now have grounds for hypothesizing functional relationships between behavior and adrenal function.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We explored the effects of recent forest fragmentation on fine-scale patterns of population structuring and genetic diversity in populations of White-ruffed Manakins (Corapipo altera) inhabiting premontane forest patches of varying size in southwestern Costa Rica. Habitat fragmentation is a major conservation concern for avian populations worldwide, but studies on the genetic effects of fragmentation on Neotropical birds are limited. We sampled 159 manakins from nine forest fragments of varying size and isolation within an 18 kilometer radius, and genotyped these birds at 13 microsatellite loci. Bayesian clustering methods revealed that birds from all fragments comprised a single genetic population, and F-statistics showed only modest levels of differentiation between forest patches. We calculated allelic diversity indices for each fragment but found no correlation between genetic diversity and fragment size. These results suggest two possibilities: first, these manakins may retain substantial connectivity via inter-fragment dispersal despite habitat fragmentation, or if dispersal is currently limited, the short period of a half-century since fragmentation may not have been sufficient to impose genetic structuring or to erode allelic diversity.</dc:description>

<dc:title>MHC Class I Sequence Polymorphism in Horses and Donkeys</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Campbell, Julie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study investigated the number of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I genes in donkeys, their polymorphism, and their phylogenetic relationship to MHC class I genes of the horse.  It has been found through bioinformatic analysis of MHC class I sequences of horses of different haplotypes that classical MHC class I alleles commonly fall within four loci, with additional individual genes that do not fit within any of the four loci.  Conserved regions of horse and donkey MHC class I sequences were used to design PCR primers that amplified donkey class I genes.  RT-PCR reactions were carried out on donkey lymphocyte cDNA.  The MEGA 3 program was used to cluster related sequences and to assign them to individual loci.  Donkey sequences followed a similar pattern to that of the horse, having a few loci that contain many of the alleles and additional MHC class I loci that may be unique to one or only a few MHC haplotypes. The donkey alleles fell into either previously established horse loci or loci unique to donkeys.  Loci shared between horses and donkeys are probably older loci, having evolved before the split of hoses and donkeys, while loci detected in only one species may be younger.  Comparing the allelic variation between horses and donkeys will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of the highly variant MHC region.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Bioassay of Vitamin A2 in the Retinal Tissue of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, Using Microspectrophotometry and 2D-Imaging</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Charles, Brandon</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Zebrafish have been shown to utilize the vitamin A1 chromophore in synthesizing their visual pigments.  Recent evidence suggests that they may also be able to utilize vitamin A2 under both natural conditions and after treatment with thyroxine.  To test for the presence of vitamin A2 in the retinae of zebrafish and map its location, I combined microspectrophotometric (MSP) analysis with 2D-imaging.  MSP measures the absorbance spectra of visual pigments within single photoreceptors, while 2D-imaging uses differential bleaching to attempt differentiation of those regions rich in A1 pigment from those containing A2. Previous MSP has found the occasional A2 cell in some fish, but failed to demonstrate a specific area or island utilizing the A2 chromophore in zebrafish, possibly due to sampling problems of the MSP technique.  Unfortunately, the 2D-imaging failed to show enough contrast between bleached and unbleached retinal regions to determine if, in fact, bleaching occurred at all.  &#xd;
In an attempt to enrich the retina in vitamin A2, thyroxine treated eyecup cultures were used.  In this case the hope was to stimulate A2 synthesis in cultured eyecup preparations.  MSP was used to monitor changes in vitamin A2-based pigment.  There was a failure to observe A2 synthesis in culture.  While the most likely culture conditions were tried first, it is believed that these were NOT conducive to zebrafish retinal culture.  This study has demonstrated methodological challenges that need to be solved before the original question can be satisfactorily addressed.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The Mammalian Oviductal Sperm Reservoir: Identification of Receptors for Bull Sperm on the Oviductal Epithelium</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cho, Margaret</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In eutherian mammals, a storage reservoir is formed when sperm become trapped in the initial segment of the oviduct by binding to the epithelium lining its wall. In bull sperm, seminal vesicle secretory proteins in the bovine seminal plasma (BSP) protein family, namely PDC-109 (BSP A1/A2), BSP-A3, and BSP-30-kDa, coat the sperm head and enable sperm to bind to the oviductal epithelium. This study was undertaken to identify at least one receptor for BSP-30-kDa on the oviductal epithelium. Proteins extracted from apical plasma membranes of the oviductal epithelium were added to a column of BSP-30-kDa bound to anti-BSP-30-kDa covalently conjugated to Protein-A agarose beads. Unbound proteins were washed from the beads and proteins that bound to the column were eluted by adding EGTA, a calcium chelator, because sperm binding to the oviductal epithelium is dependent on calcium. The eluates were resolved on SDS PAGE gels, and silver staining detected two prominent bands of approximately 37 and 34 kDa. Tandem mass spectrometry identified the protein constituents of the bands as annexins (ANXA) 1, 2, and 4. Anti-annexin antibodies also labeled the cilia and apical surfaces of the epithelium in sections of bovine oviduct. Annexins belong to a multigene family of calcium-dependent, phospholipid binding proteins. Annexins are important in several biological processes such as cell adhesion, ion channel modulation, signal transduction, and regulation of membrane structure. It was concluded that annexins are primary candidates for the sperm receptors on bovine oviductal epithelium.</dc:description>

<dc:title>MRE11 is Unlikely to be an Essential Component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mismatch Repair Pathway</dc:title>
<dc:creator>English, Justin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>hMRE11 has recently been implicated as a primary factor in human mismatch repair (MMR), a process which acts to improve DNA replication fidelity.  Mutations in hMRE11 have been identified in human nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) related tumors and in vivo mutator assays suggest that knockdown of this gene causes frameshift mutations.  I report that the deletion of MRE11 from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome increases the mutation rate but does not significantly enhance the rate of frameshift mutations as seen in other yeast MMR mutants.  In addition, unlike in mammalian systems, I was unable to observe yeast two-hybrid interaction between MRE11 and MLH1.  This combined evidence suggests that MRE11 is unlikely to be a major player in yeast MMR.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The effects of aedeskinin III and analogues on transepithelial electrolyte and fluid secretion in Malpighian tubules of the yellow fever mosquito</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fox, Andrew</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The effects of synthetic aedeskinin III on transepithelial electrolyte and fluid secretion were studied in isolated Malpighian tubules of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti.  Isolated Malpighian tubules were prepared for measurements of fluid secretion rates by the method of Ramsay. After measuring a control rate of fluid secretion, aedeskinin III was added to the peritubular Ringer solution.  Rates of transepithelial fluid secretion significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner at aedeskinin concentrations ranging from 10-5 to 10-9M.  Maximal stimulatory effects were observed at 1 ?M aedeskinin III, which increased the fluid secretion rate from 0.667 to 1.451 nl/min.  EC50 for aedeskinin III was calculated as 1.028x10-7M.  In the presence of 1 ?M aedeskinin III, the Na+ concentration in secreted fluid significantly decreased from 130.5 to 88.2 mM and the Cl- concentration in secreted fluid significantly decreased from 208.6 to 173.5 mM.  The increase in the K+ concentration from 82.1 mM to 90.3 mM was not significant.  The product of the fluid secretion rate and electrolyte secretion yields the electrolyte secretion rate.  Accordingly, the transepithelial secretion rate for Na+ increased from 96.3 pmols/min to 127.6 pmols/min, the K+ secretion rate increased from 61.6 pmols/min to 141.2 pmols/min, and the Cl- secretion rate increased from 153.9 to 257.5 pmols/min.  However, only the effects on K+ and Cl- secretion were statistically significant.  Synthetic aedeskinin-receptor agonists 1577 and 1460II also stimulated fluid secretion at 1 ?M concentrations, increasing fluid secretion rate from 0.716 to 1.224 nl/min and from 0.889 to 1.615 nl/min, respectively.  The in vitro longevity of isolated Malpighian tubules was also assessed.  Isolated tubules cultured in Ringer solution and Grace?s insect medium (pH 6.1) did not survive the process and did not secrete fluid one day after isolation.  However, when kept in Grace?s insect medium at pH 7.1, the tubules still secreted one day later.  These studies confirm that aedeskinin III has diuretic effects in Aedes Malpighian tubules.  Rates of transepithelial secretion of NaCl and KCl increased, suggesting that the mechanism of action of aedeskinin III is similar to that of leucokinin.  My study documents further and for the first time that synthetic analogs of aedeskinin containing ?-amino acids retain diuretic potency.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Hawaii Residents' Attitudes Towards the Management of an Invasive Frog Species (Eleutherodactylus coqui)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gonzalez-Pagan, Omar</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The coqui frog Eleutherodactylus coqui was unintentionally introduced to Hawaii in the late 1980?s. Since its introduction, the frog has been discovered in four islands: Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and Island of Hawaii. Much research has been done regarding the management of the coqui frog, including evaluation of control options involving the use citric acid, hydrated lime and chytrid fungus; however, little research has been done to address the societal impacts of the coqui frogs or the attitudes of Hawaii residents and their support for various management options. A self-administered mail questionnaire was used to evaluate Hawaii residents? perceptions toward the frog and its management.   (32.4% response rate, n=653). A majority (72.4%) of respondents do not enjoy the presence of the coqui frog and consider it a nuisance while others (20.1%) simply do not care about it. Residents of the Island of Hawaii and those who had been born in Hawaii State are more likely to consider the frog a nuisance and to favor the different management options compared to residents of other islands and those not born in Hawaii. Although most respondents considered it very important for the government to manage the coqui frog, support for management decreased when respondents were asked about their support for specific management methods, most of which are lethal to the frog.  Using the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) Scale, it was revealed that most respondents tended to have a proenvironmental orientation. Respondents? knowledge and proenvironmental orientation were associated with the degree of management that they would support. However, a proenvironmental orientation was not always associated with support for the management of the coqui frog.  Managers may be able to use communication strategies to increase public understanding about the ecological impacts of the coqui and the implications of specific management options, appealing to Hawaii residents? proenvironmental orientation.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Why does parental effort of the common tern (Sterna hirundo) decrease after a late-season flooding event?  A multi-hypothesis approach</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Grummer, Jared</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The production of two clutches within the same breeding season is uncommon amongst many shorebirds species, and even more rare is the act of double-brooding.  In late June of 2006, heavy rains flooded over 120 common tern (Sterna hirundo) nests, causing a re-nesting effort of over 140 pairs, and perhaps one case of double-brooding.  To evaluate the level of parental effort after a late-season flooding event, I weighed and then compared the eggs of the second clutches to corresponding egg data from the first clutches of 1983 and 1984 from the same colony on Oneida Lake, NY.  The mean egg weights from the second clutch of 2006 all weighed significantly less than the corresponding mean egg weights of the first clutches of 1983 and 1984.  In both first and second clutches, there was a linear decrease in egg weight with laying order.  Three hypotheses have been postulated to explain the intraclutch variation of egg weights, the ?brood-survival?, ?brood-reduction?, and ?insurance? hypotheses attempt.  Given the circumstances of 2006, the brood-reduction hypothesis fits best at explaining the intraclutch variation in egg weights.&#xd;
The observed decline in parental effort late in the season can be explained by the ?timing? hypothesis, which in the case of this study included a decreased food supply and reduced breeding synchrony later in the season.  Certain aspects of the life history of common terns such as molt, which overlapped with the production of the second clutch, as well as the allocation of energy between parents in a bi-parental care system, also decreased the success of many second clutches.  Many adults associated with second clutch nests abandoned their eggs and/or chicks in order to enhance the probability of their own survival.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Specificity of herbivore-induced secondary metabolite responses in tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hogan, Andrew</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Plants respond to herbivore damage with a bewildering array of metabolic responses. To what degree such responses are specific to particular herbivore species and how plants respond to multiple attackers are questions of extensive scientific debate because their answers are fundamental to the understanding of the ecological consequences of plant induced responses to herbivory. In a field experiment, I investigate the nature of secondary metabolite and defensive protein production in Solidago altissima when elicited by two different herbivore species, the larvae of the galling fly Eurosta solidaginis and the chrysomelid beetle Trirhabda virgata, individually or at the same time. The chemical analysis of leaf tissue reveals differential responses in both trypsin proteinase inhibitor production and volatile organic compound emission when goldenrod plants are damaged by either herbivore individually or the two in combination. Our findings suggest damage-specific elicitation and signal transduction for each herbivore individually and for when both attack simultaneously.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Structure of BAR and PX domains of Sorting Nexin 9 reveals cooperativity in membrane binding</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kaan, Hung Yi Kristal</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) belongs to a larger family of BAR-domain containing proteins. It is characterized by an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a phox homology (PX) domain, and a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs-homology (BAR) domain. Together with clathrin and dynamin, it functions mainly in the endocytic pathway to sort proteins. SNX9 has also been shown to regulate receptor-mediated endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), by its interaction with Activated Cdc42-associated kinase-2 (ACK2), thus implicating a role for SNX9 in signal transduction.&#xd;
	Although the main cellular functions of SNX9 have been brought to light, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which this multi-domain protein participates in endocytosis and signaling. It is also unclear if and how the protein is regulated. In order to understand the interactions between the various domains of SNX9, we have crystallized and solved the structure of a shorter construct of SNX9 (here after called SNX9PX-BAR), which consists of only the PX and BAR domains. By analyzing this multi-domain structure and by conducting lipid- and vesicle-binding assays, we are able to gain a better understanding of how the two domains interact to influence the membrane binding ability of SNX9. &#xd;
	Our analysis of the structure of SNX9PX-BAR shows a dimeric BAR domain that is moderately curved. The BAR domain forms stable dimers via mainly hydrophobic interactions on the membrane surface. Membrane binding is most likely driven by electrostatic interactions between the PX-BAR domain and the negatively-charged plasma membrane. In addition, the PX domain of SNX9 shows high and specific binding affinity to PI(3)P, which is in high concentrations in early endosomes. Therefore, we propose that SNX9 might be localized to both the plasma membrane and the early endosomes to participate in endocytosis and sorting of vesicles.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Changes in fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) song over a forty-four year period in New England waters</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Koltz, Amanda</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Although much marine mammal research has been conducted on whales in the waters surrounding Cape Cod, Massachusetts, little work has been done on the supposed resident fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) population that resides in this area.  Fin whales have three different sounds in their vocal repertoire but a relatively simple song that is composed of long trains of high intensity 20-Hz pulses.  Performed only by males, the song may be a reproductive display with song characteristics evolutionarily fixed within populations.  In this study, fin whale vocalizations recorded in the area of Cape Cod Bay during the years 1961, 1978, 2001, and 2005 were characterized and compared within years to detect possible divergence in the male song.  Reliable comparisons with the earlier data proved difficult because of small sample sizes under the chosen song parameters.  However, measurements of inter-pulse interval and song length did vary significantly between the short time span of 2001 to 2005.  Mean inter-pulse intervals were shorter in 2001, and song duration was longer within the 2005 recordings.  Negative correlations between the center frequency and the song duration, as well as the center frequency and inter-pulse interval were also found.  Although we rejected the null hypothesis that song notes and features are fixed and do not change over time, we did discover valuable information regarding the relationships between different features of fin whale song.  Based on comparison of the temporal and individual variation observed in our data with those collected on a population in Bermuda, it is unclear whether vocal characteristics are distinct and could be an identifying feature of separate breeding populations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The phase diagram of the DSPC/DOPC/cholesterol biomembrane model system was recently determined by studies in our laboratory.  However, the component DOPC does not occur in animal cell plasma membranes, but was chosen for convenience in solving the phase diagram. In my study, DOPC was replaced stepwise by the naturally-occurring SOPC to determine its effect on the high cholesterol boundary of the L?+Lo two-phase region. Giant unilamellar vesicles with the chosen compositions, probed with the fluorescent dye C12:0-DiI, were made by electroswelling and their phase behaviors were examined by fluorescence microscopy. From 0 to 45% replacement of DOPC by SOPC, the middle part of the boundary shifts only a small amount, from cholesterol mole fraction 0.38 down to mole fraction 0.30 ? 0.35. The L? side of the boundary remains essentially unchanged. Above 50% replacement, photo-induced artifacts obscure the real phase behavior at the middle part of the boundary, but might represent the actual boundary termination.  Above 70% replacement of DOPC by SOPC, no phase-separation was observed for the L? side of the boundary. The size and shape of the L?+Lo two-phase region can be related to the structures of the lipids.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Relaxation of microhabitat restriction through ontogeny of Itea virginica in cypress-tupelo swamps</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Landi, Alicia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Nearly all understory plant species in semi-permanently flooded cypress-tupelo swamp forests grow on microsites located above the water level, as opposed to growing on the flooded forest floor. Our field study indicates that one such species, Itea virginica (Saxifragaceae), has a strong association with elevated microsites that changes with life  stage: adults are found significantly more often on the forest floor than seedlings, although not as frequently as expected for the amount of forest floor vs. elevated microsites present. High water level may inhibit seedling establishment, but not adult growth, thus suggesting a potential ontogenetic expansion of flooding tolerance. We conducted greenhouse flooding experiments on seedlings and adults of various sizes with three treatments: high flood (a percentage of aboveground biomass submerged), waterlogged (only root systems submerged), and control (no flooding). The effect of initial height above water and treatment on relative growth rate was significant for the seedlings: RGR decreased with increasing flood level; however, there was no significant effect for adults. Seedlings were more negatively affected by flooding than adults due primarily to their small size rather than any differences in ability to produce flood responses (i.e., enlarged lenticels or adventitious roots). Additionally, we conducted seed experiments investigating the effects of different substrates and durations of flooding on germination success; there were no significant effects of either factor on seed germination. This study increases our understanding of regeneration biology and can be valuable in planning restoration activities in cypress-tupelo swamps.</dc:description>

<dc:title>When getting a meal may cost your life: Exploring the incongruous distribution between the green crab Carcinus maenas and its prey</dc:title>
<dc:creator>League-Pike, Paloma</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The green crab Carcinus maenas invaded the Gulf of Maine over a hundred years ago and has become a well-established member of intertidal communities. We surveyed the vertical distribution of Carcinus, other crabs, and their potential prey from the intertidal into the shallow subtidal. Carcinus was most abundant in the intertidal and decreased in the subtidal. In contrast, a preferred prey of Carcinus, the mussel Mytilus edulis, had highest densities in the shallow subtidal. Why isn?t Carcinus most abundant where prey densities are highest? A previous experiment revealed a higher mortality rate for Carcinus tethered in the subtidal than in the intertidal. In the subtidal there are higher abundances of the American lobster Homarus americanus and Jonah crab Cancer borealis. We performed a laboratory experiment to investigate the effects of cohabitation with lobster and C. borealis on survival, shelter use, and behavior of Carcinus. Lobsters were the more effective predator on Carcinus, consuming 27% of the crabs during 24 hours. Only 5% of Carcinus were eaten by C. borealis and none by conspecifics used in control treatments. In the presence of lobsters, Carcinus showed significantly more climbing and deep burrowing behavior relative to controls. Our results suggest that the risk of predation by lobsters underlies the scarcity of Carcinus in subtidal communities.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Dynamics of Supralittoral Freshwater Rock Pools in the Gulf of Maine</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Levas, Stephen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Appledore Island, located six miles off the coast of Portsmouth, NH, has over 500 freshwater peripheral pools situated above the intertidal zone and range in size from semi permanent pools measuring 15 centimeters across to larger permanent pools up to about 10m diameter.  Seventy eight pools were physically monitored once every four days from June to August 2006 and have provided us with a deeper understanding on dynamics of pond community organization and how organisms cope with rapid and major physical changes.  Pools were monitored for temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, water color and clarity, and presence or absence of key macrofauna. The color and clarity of pools, which we used as a proxy for phytoplankton levels, varied throughout the summer and ranged between being always opaque to always clear, or cycling between these two states.  Cycling of pools is important for the macrofauna because it indicates varying conditions that organisms must contend with.  Clear pools had significantly lower dissolved oxygen levels, pH values and presumably, based on water clarity, lower phytoplankton stocks, while opaque pools had higher levels of both dissolved oxygen and pH and usually very high phytoplankton levels.  Diel vertical migration by Daphnia. pulex was observed in these island pools which is interesting because of the lack of vertebrate predators.  Significantly higher densities of D. pulex occurred in the top 10cm during the night than day.  With the absence of significant predators, physical or genetic factors must explain the observed migration to the surface at night by D. pulex.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The role of aphid host preference in barley yellow dwarf virus epidemiology</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lowry, Erin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Viral infection can cause changes to a plant?s morphology or chemical composition that may alter its desirability to the insect vector.  In combination with viral persistence in the vector, prevalence of the disease, and the spatial distribution of infected plants, vector preference for virus-infected or uninfected individuals can strongly influence the rate of disease spread in plant communities (McElhany et al. 1995).  Although it is known that the presence of a virus in the host plant can lead to a change in feeding behavior and an increase in fecundity (Fereres et al. 1990, Fereres et al. 1989, Montllor and Gildow 1986), there is little evidence that vectors prefer infected hosts over uninfected hosts.  In this study, I examined host preference of the grass-feeding aphids Rhopalosiphum maidis, R. padi and Sitobion avenae when offered a variety of grasses infected or uninfected with the PAV species of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV).  The eight grass species used in the preference tests are commonly found in New York State and are known hosts of BYDV.  Preference tests were carried out in cages, where adult aphids were allowed to choose among grass seedlings.  To determine whether infection altered preference, aphids were offered either uninfected grass communities or communities that contained a mixture of infected and uninfected grass seedlings.  Results from these trials indicated strong species-specific preferences by aphids for particular grasses.  Although there was some indication that infection could alter preference, I found no evidence that infection caused a significant shift in preference ranking among grasses.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The Functionality of Marek's Disease Virus Us3 Protein</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McKinney, Caleb</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Marek's disease (MD) is a lymphoproliferative disease of chickens caused by cell-associated Marek's disease virus (MDV). The Us3 protein kinase expressed by MDV has been shown to be involved in various stages of the viral life cycle. Deletion of the Us3 open reading frame resulted in an accumulation of primarily enveloped virions in the perinuclear space which led to a reduction in viral titers (Schumacher et al., 2005). It was also shown that the Us3 protein is involved in actin stress fiber breakdown. In this study we constructed a recombinant virus (Us3*220A) to determine the significance of the Us3 kinase activity. Disruption of the kinase activity was achieved by substituting a lysine in the active site of the protein with an alanine. Titers of the kinase-negative virus were reduced when compared to parental virus in a similar fashion as the previously described Us3 deletion mutant.  We were able to show complete absence of direct phosphorylation of an MDV-specific phosphoprotein, pp38 by pUs3*220A. Surprisingly, expression of pUs3*220A mediated breakdown of the actin cytoskeleton 24h after transfection of chicken embryo fibroblasts in the same way wildtype pUs3* does.  At 48h post transfection the actin cytoskeleton was fully restored in almost all transfected cells. Our results show that the Us3 and pp38 proteins comprise a kinase-substrate pair but that not all of Us3 functions are mediated by its kinase activity.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Regulation of Proto-Dbl through the Ubox Domain of CHIP</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Muakkassa, Nora</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Dbl protein is a product of a proto-oncogene that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho-family GTPases. It is responsible for activating the GTPases by facilitating the dissociation of GDP thus allowing for the binding of GTP. Intracellular levels of Dbl are regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. CHIP is the E3 protein-ubiquitin ligase responsible for this ubiquitination. More specifically, the Ubox domain of CHIP is critical to this interaction. Oncogenic Dbl, which lacks its spectrin domain, cannot bind CHIP and therefore escapes degradation. This causes accumulation of the oncogene product in the cell, and leads to persistent activation of its downstream pathways.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Engineering a Synthetic Extra-Cellular Matrix for In Vitro Cartilage Tissue Production</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Owens, Gwen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this study, growth factor binding found in natural extra-cellular matrix (ECM) was mimicked by a modified polymer scaffold that could attract either Insulin-Like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I), a growth factor known to stimulate ECM production by chondrocytes, and Transforming Growth Factor-B1 (TGF-B1), a growth factor known to induce chondrogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells.&#xd;
&#xd;
Short growth factor-binding peptides were synthesized and covalently attached to an alginate polymer scaffold.  Using self-assembled monolayer (SAM) chemistry, these modified alginate layers were characterized using Imaging Ellipsometry (IE).  Affinity of each growth factor for its respective synthetic peptide was quantified via Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).  The density of binding peptides bound to alginate was determined using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR).  Computational diffusion modeling was used to design an ELISA-based diffusion experiment.  Mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes were grown in chemically modified-alginate beads with and without added growth factor; modification increased ECM production in both kinds of cells.  Thus, through this novel system of peptide-modified alginate scaffolds, growth factors were specifically but non-covalently retained by alginate, allowing for controlled release of growth factors.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Characterizing the foraging ecology of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of eggshells</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Paddock, Sara</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Stable isotopes are useful tools for discerning information regarding the foraging ecology of far-ranging animals like sea turtles.  Isotope signatures of prey items are integrated into the turtles? tissues in a characteristic manner, and in the case of nesting females, eggshell isotopic signatures can provide insight into the trophic status and foraging locations of the adult females.  By sampling eggshells from nesting beaches, one can obtain a unique, wide-range perspective that might not be observed by sampling turtles directly within foraging areas.  In the present study, leatherback turtle eggshells were collected from 21 different nests on the nesting beach in Jamursba Medi, Papua, Indonesia in the Western Pacific in July 2003.  Habitat samples, including particulate organic matter, krill, gelatinous organisms, squid, and small fish were collected with dip nets and bongo tows in the Eastern Pacific, off the west coast of the United States. Eggshell ?13C values were similar for all eggshell samples (-13.2 ? 1.2 ?).  However, there was a dichotomy in ?15N values, with 62% of the eggshells in the 9.2?-10.8? range and 38% in the 12.5?-14.5? range.  Comparing these values with the ?15N values of habitat samples analyzed in this study and others as well as with information on Pacific-wide nitrogen fixation/denitrification patterns, suggests that these two ?15N groupings represent animals foraging in the Western Pacific and Eastern Pacific, respectively.  These data are consistent with satellite telemetry data and suggest that ?15N isotope analysis can be an effective, non-invasive method to gain knowledge about turtle foraging locations that may prove useful in conservation efforts.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Retronasal but not oral-cavity identifications of air-phase trigeminal stimuli</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Parikh, Vijal</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Single concentrations of six odorants (eugenol, heptyl alcohol, nonanal, 1-octanol, dl-menthol, valeric acid) were selected to be trigeminal stimuli, based upon previous studies done through anosmics (individuals that lack a functional olfactory system). The stimuli were presented in random order three time each in vapor-phase either retronasally or oral-cavity-only. They were identified on a digital computer by 20 subjects (ages 18 to 35, 9 females). Retronasal presentations were produced by inhaling via the mouth with a nose clip closing the nostrils, and then removing the nose clip and exhaling from the nose. Oral-cavity-only presentations were produced by inhalation via the mouth with a nose clip closing the nostrils, and exhalation from the mouth with the nose clip remaining in place. This study investigates if subjects could identify odorants when restricted to the oral-cavity-only using the same identifiers of the odorants when presented retronasally. RESULTS: Median percent retronasal correct identifications [correct identification terms are shown in brackets] were: eugenol, 100% [cloves or spice]; heptyl alcohol, 67% [cleaner]; nonanal, 58% [citrus or floral]; 1-octanol, 71% [citrus or cleaner]; dl-menthol, 100% [ointment or peppermint]; valeric acid, 67% [rancid or sweat].   Median percent correct oral-cavity-only identifications were all 0%, except for dl-menthol, for which percent correct oral-cavity-only median correct identification was 67%. A Friedman Non-Parametric ANOVA statistical analysis showed significant difference between odorants presented oral-cavity-only versus retronasal. Pairwise comparisons showed significant differences between odorants presented oral-cavity-only versus retronasal for all odorants except for dl-menthol. CONCLUSIONS: Many vapor-phase 'trigeminal' odorants can be identified only when access to the nasal cavity (retronasal) occurs, but substantial correct identification of vapor-phase dl-menthol also occurs when restricted to the oral cavity (oral-cavity-only).  Odorants similar to dl-menthol may contribute to flavor from both the oral and nasal cavities.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Aerial competition for feathers by Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ringelman, Kevin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>During the breeding season, Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) scavenge for feathers and use them to line their nests.  Nest lining is known to be an important factor in Tree Swallow reproductive success, but competition for feathers has never been experimentally studied despite the fact that acrobatic aerial competitions for feathers are frequent and easily observable.  To examine the proximate and ultimate causes of feather contests, I manipulated the nest-lining of breeding swallows and then observed individual behaviors throughout the breeding season.  Both males and females gathered feathers, beginning with nest construction and continuing through chick rearing.  It is clear that there are two distinct methods of feather gathering: feather ?collection,? an early-season behavior characterized by a lack of interaction with other birds, and feather ?contests,? conspicuous, aggressive interactions involving several birds.  Contests over larger feathers were more intense than those over smaller feathers.  Early-season contest winners tended to exhibit drop-catch displays with the feather, had well-feathered nests, and were ultimately reproductively successful; there is some evidence that these contest winners may be higher quality individuals.  The number of feathers in the nest at the time of a contest was also an important determinant of behavior.  A late-season individual with a well-feathered nest tended to participate less in contests and drop the feather more frequently.  The associations and feedbacks among contest performance, individual quality, the number of feathers in the nest, and reproductive success indicate that feather contests involve complex behaviors that are highly variable among individuals and change in response to varying conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Identification and Characterization of Lethal 6: a Chromosome 5 Embryonic Lethal Mutation in Mus musculus</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Stenson, Erin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mus Musculus was randomly mutagenized using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU).  Mutations on Chromosome 5 were selected using the Rw inversion, a visibly marked, recessive, lethal inversion that covers almost fifty megabases (Mb).   Multiple mutations were isolated from the subsequent three-generation mutagenesis screen, one of which was lethal 6.  Using a combination of complementation tests and recombinational mapping, the lethal 6 region was narrowed down to less than 1.4 (Mb).  There were thirty-eight candidate genes in this region of which 4 had already been mutated and yielded viable progeny.  The coding regions of 80% of the remaining thirty-four genes have been ruled out from being lethal 6, although it is still possible that ENU affected the regulation of one of these genes.  Mice homozygous for lethal 6 die around E8.0 and preliminary results from blastocyst outgrowth assays suggest that they are unable to implant.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Defining the Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Transport of CPV Capsids in Cells</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tan, Min Jie Alvin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a non-enveloped virus that replicates in the nucleus during infection.  While it is known that it uses the cell?s microtubule network to traverse the cytoplasm, the route of nuclear entry is unclear.  The nuclear pore complex was thought to be used by the virus due to the presence of nuclear localization sequences (NLS) in the VP1 protein.  But recent studies in the minute virus of mice (MVM) have proposed that it induces breaks in the nuclear envelop before entering the nucleus via these breaks.  In this study, Crandell Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells stably transfected with GFP-lamin A/C were micro-injected with CPV capsids whose distribution within the cells was then detected using fluorescent-labeled antibodies.  The CPV capsids did not appear to induce breaks in the nuclear lamin structure of the cells that was observed for the MVM.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Small G-protein activation in articular chondrocytes by interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and osteogenic protein-1</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Torre, Christopher</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The studies outlined in this honor?s thesis were designed to better understand the mechanisms at both the cellular and molecular levels associated with the onset of osteoarthritis.  The horse was used as a model organism, and the experiments were performed on normal equine chondrocytes cultured   in   vitro.  Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) are known to have catabolic effects on the cartilage matrix while osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) is a known anabolic factor.  There is no complimentary information regarding the effects of these peptides on small G-protein (Cdc42, Rac, and Rho) activation in articular chondrocytes. The objectives of the present study were to determine the activation status of Cdc42, Rac, and Rho after treatment with IL-6, IL-8, or OP-1.  The G-proteins play an important role in the maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton and chondrocyte phenotype, so they are of interest because of their clinical relevance in regards to osteoarthritis.  To determine a suitable dose for use in these activation assays, chondrocytes were treated in vitro with varying concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, or OP-1, and changes in RNA transcripts of MMP-3, MMP-13, Col2A1, and Aggrecan were quantified using RT-PCR.  In the case of IL-6, IL-8, and OP-1, it was determined that a dose of 100ng/mL media stimulated catabolism/anabolism. Chondrocytes were also examined using confocal microscopy following treatment with IL-6, IL-8, or OP-1 to determine if a correlation exists between the normal vs fibroblastic phenotypes and the activation status of the small G-proteins.  &#xd;
Our initial hypothesis was that IL-6 and IL-8 would increase Cdc42 and Rac and decrease Rho activity, while OP-1 would have an opposite effect.  Activity of the small G-proteins was determined through an affinity binding assay and subsequent western analysis.  To date, our experiments indicate that treatment of the chondrocytes with IL-6 and IL-8 resulted in a decreased activity status of Cdc42 and Rac, which is contrary to the initial hypothesis.  Studies to determine the effects of OP-1 and the activation status of Rho in response to all treatments are nearing completion.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Effects of Matrix Metalloproteinase-13 on Extracellular Matrix Molecule Synthesis and Small GTPase Activation in Articular Chondrocytes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Battista, Jennifer</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The degerative joint disease, osteoarthritis (OA), is a leading cause of disability in both humans and animals. OA involves the degradation of articular cartilage, which functions to dissipate tensile forces and cushion the joint1. Cartilage degeneration in OA is the result of multiple events including enzymatic degradation of matrix components and malfunction of the intracellular signaling pathways in chondrocytes 2. Traditionally, the catabolic cytokine interlukin-1, also called catabolin, has been used to induce an OA phenotype for in vitro experiments3, 4. Recent studies, however, indicate that matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), also termed collagenase-3, is chiefly responsible for cartilage deterioration2, 4, 5. Though MMP-13 has been shown to play an integral role in OA, most studies to date have focused on proteoglycan cleavage mechanisms and the characterization of MMP-13 cell-surface binding and internalization 2, 3, 6-9. Thus it is the broad objective of this Honors Research Project to determine the effects of equine MMP-13 on the matrix molecule expression of chondrocytes and on the activation states of the small G-proteins of the Rho family (Cdc42, Rac, RhoA), and compare the results to those achieved after treatment with IL-1. To accomplish these aims, equine recombinant MMP-13 (eqrMMP-13) was cloned, inserted into a protein expression vector, and expressed as the active enzyme. To evaluate the expression of extracellular matrix molecules, chondrocytes were plated in monolayer, treated with eqrMMP-13, and total RNA was extracted and evaluated using quantitative RT-PCR. Assessment of the effect of MMP-13 GTPase activation was accomplished by treating chondrocytes in monolayer, retaining active GTP-bound GTPases from cell lysates using a GST fusion protein containing the binding domain of a down-stream target, in pull-down assays, and analyzing the retained proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and western analysis, in addition to confocal microscopy. This study showed that MMP-13 induced similar changes in matrix molecule expression as IL-1 and significantly upregulated gene expression of the catabolic factor MMP-3, while down regulating gene expression of the anabolic factor collagen II B (Col2A1). Preliminary data from the pull-down assays indicate that IL-1 and MMP-13 decrease the activation status of Rac, and increase the activation status of RhoA. Confocal microscopy images support these findings. Together the results of this study suggest utilizing MMP-13 to induce the OA phenotype is an acceptable model of cartilage degradation in vitro. This may better mimic the native articular environment, and lead to more clinically translatable results than studies using IL-1 chondrocyte cultures.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Genetic and Phenotypic Characterization of Listeria monocytogenes Strains with Attenuated Virulence</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Broton, Claire</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Epidemiological studies have provided considerable evidence that Listeria monocytogenes strains differ in their ability and relative likelihood to cause human disease. Multiple mutations leading to premature stop codons (PMSCs) have been identified in the key L. monocytogenes virulence gene inlA, which codes for a surface protein that mediates the entry of L. monocytogenes into host cells. Mutations leading to premature stop codons in inlA are associated with a reduced invasion phenotype in vitro, supporting the hypothesis that these mutations may also be responsible for attenuated human virulence. In order to further define the frequency of L. monocytogenes strains with reduced invasion capability, 207 isolates had previously been screened for ability to invade Caco-2 cells (Nightingale, unpublished). The inlA gene was sequenced for 27 isolates that showed attenuated ability to invade the epithelial cell line. Sequencing revealed mutations leading to PMSCs in 12 of the 27 isolates, including 2 novel mutations (PMSC types 5 and 7) and 3 previously reported mutations (PMSC types 1, 4 and 6). All but one of the isolates with confirmed PMSC mutations in inlA were isolated from food products or food processing plants. Our data support the hypothesis that L. monocytogenes isolates associated with food have attenuated invasion due to the presence of inlA PMSCs. Our data further suggest that sequence variation in inlA is an important factor that can be used to define L. monocytogenes that have a reduced ability to cause human disease. Since some strains with PMSCs in inlA were common in foods and environmental samples and were found in high levels in foods, it was hypothesized that these mutations may provide selective advantage, possibly outside a human host. Isogenic inlA PMSC strains were thus tested for their growth in rich medium and their resistance against common sanitizing agents. The results indicate that there is little difference in growth trends or sanitizer resistance between isogenic strains with and without inlA PMSC. It thus appears that inlA PMSCs do not enhance the ability of L. monocytogenes to grow in rich media or to be resistant to sanitizing agents.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Assessment of the Effects of Perinatal Choline Treatment on Attention and Reactivity to Reward Omission in a Mouse Model of Down Syndrome</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gandhy, Shruti</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by the trisomy of chromosome 21 in humans. Almost all individuals with DS also experience an early onset of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and show similar cognitive and learning deficits. There are currently no treatments for these deficits in DS. However, choline availability during the perinatal period has shown to have long-term benefits on memory and attentional function. This study utilized a series of attentional tests that evaluated the benefits of perinatal choline treatment in Ts65Dn mice, an animal model of Down syndrome. Specifically, we used the ?Surprising Reward Omission? (SRO) Task in which an expected reward is omitted on 20% of the correct responses, to test attentional dysfunction and heightened error reactivity in these mice. Since previous SRO studies with Ts65Dn mice have shown an increase in locomotor activity and stereotypic behaviors such as jumping and grooming following reward omission, we supplemented our findings on overall performance with an analysis of video data. We hypothesized that the Ts65Dn mice will exhibit an exaggerated response to the omission of an expected reward relative to controls, which will be reflected by their poor performance on the SRO task, and that choline treatment will alleviate these dysfunctions. Our results indicated that the unsupplemented Ts65Dn mice had significant attentional dysfunction and reacted to incorrect responses with increased activity level. These abnormalities in Ts65Dn mice were normalized by perinatal choline supplementation. The reward omission did not significantly affect the performance of any of the mice (in terms of correct responses). Yet the elevated alcove latencies and omission errors in unsupplemented Ts65Dn mice provided some indication of increased reaction to reward omission. We expect the behavioral video analysis (in progress) to elucidate the exact nature of these reactions and the effect of choline treatment on arousal regulation and subsequent behaviors in Ts65Dn mice.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Synthetic Lethal Interaction Between ether-a-go-go Shaker and escargot Mutations in Drosophila</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zhang, Samantha Liang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Escargot (esg) is a member of the snail family of transcription factors. Gain-of-function esg mutantions have been identified in previous studies as strong suppressors of seizure behavior in Drosophila models for epilepsy (Hekmat-Scafe et al. 2005). Recently, during a screen utilizing the ether-a- go-go (eag) Shaker (Sh) double mutant to identify genes that affect oxidative stress sensitivity, we uncovered a lethal interaction between gain-of-function esg mutations and the eag Sh double mutant The eag and Sh genes encode potassium channel subunits; epilepsy studies have revealed that eag and Sh are also mild seizure suppressors (Kuebler et al. 2001). The esg gene interaction is thus of great interest as it rescues seizure prone mutations while causing lethality in animals with increased seizure resistance. This study investigates the lethal interaction between eag Sh and esg to better understand its underlying mechanisms. Our results indicate that lethality is caused by severely impaired motor control in the adult. The animal exhibits many adult specific phenotypes, with distinctive synaptic phenotypes in adult and larvae. These results suggest that the critical period for esg-induced lethality is during adult development which agrees with the results of epilepsy studies.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Characterizing the Meiotic Failure and Transcriptional Aberrations Caused by Mutation of A-Myb in Mice</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Barash, Alexander</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This project aims to understand the role of the transcription factor A-myb and its targets in spermatogenesis. If the project is successful, we will know how a mutation in the MybL1 gene leads to male sterility in the mouse. This information will give us a more detailed picture of the processes of meiosis and spermatogenesis, not just in the mouse but in all organisms with homologous genes and mechanisms.&#xd;
&#xd;
I used bioinformatics to pinpoint genes which were being directly affected by A-myb using microarray data from 14 and 17 day wild-type and mutant testes. In addition, antibody staining for A-MYB protein was much lower in mutant mice, suggesting protein destabilization in mutants. Several differences in histone composition were observed through antibody staining. Expression of genes that seemed to be affected in the microarray were studied using real-time PCR to determine if they have overlapping roles in spermatogenesis.&#xd;
&#xd;
The mutation in A-Myb affected many genes, most of which became downregulated. These affected genes may be transcribed by A-Myb directly or may be affected indirectly through expression of mediating genes. As more data is collected, we will be able to construct a model of A-Myb?s function in spermatogenesis and understand which genes play key roles in meiosis and spermatogenesis.&#xd;
&#xd;
Ultimately, knowledge of the inner workings of meiosis and spermatogenesis will allow for advances in human and veterinary medicine. This knowledge is especially applicable to males who are sterile.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Environmental Stewardship in Agriculture: A Case Study of the NYC Watershed System</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Williamson, Sean</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Agriculture has always been and will continue to be an important player in environmental integrity throughout the world. Because the manner in which humans manage agriculture has such serious implications on the environment and in turn people, it is imperative that some sort of environmental stewardship be practiced in agriculture. This research focuses on various methods of stimulating environmental stewardship (i.e. regulations, monetary incentives, etc.) and which method(s) might be the most suitable for agriculture. Management of agriculture in the New York City watershed system will function as a specific case for observing and evaluating how a socially-oriented management style incorporating such tools as partnerships, reciprocity and education can be formulated and implemented. Given the degree of environmental stewardship that has been fostered in the NYC watershed, the case is made that a socially-oriented form of environmental management can be incredibly effective at creating environmental stewardship in agriculture and ought to be applied on a broader scale.</dc:description>

<dc:title>A Comparative Study of Thomas Jefferson?s Travels to England and Their Influences on Monticello</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Micsak, Robert</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Monticello, located in the city of Charlottesville, Virginia, was the estate home of the third President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson. It is also said to be one of the finest surviving examples of the English Garden Landscape in America, while also establishing the Standard American landscape style. Thomas Jefferson manipulated the landscape in conjunction with architecture years before Frederick Law Olmsted coined the term landscape architect. Monticello was influenced in many different aspects of architecture and landscape architecture from France, England, and Italy. A detailed analysis of his one-month journey throughout England reveals the influences of each estate on his classic English landscape garden tour. In 1786, Thomas Jefferson made sixteen stops throughout the United Kingdom, and by tracing and analyzing his steps, the thesis bridges the gap that exists regarding the current verbal and visual analysis of the English influence on Monticello. These stops included, Chiswick, Hampton Court, Twickenham, Esher-Place, Claremont, Painshill, Lord Loughborough?s Woburn Farm, Caversham, Wotton, Stowe, Leasowes, Hagley, Blenheim Palace, Enfield Chase, Moor Park, and Kew. The exploration of each park, estate, or garden using satellite images, photographs, photographic manipulation, and literature searches are used to reveal the visual similarities, differences, existing landscape forms and influences of English Estates and Gardens upon Monticello. Although there have been many articles, books, theses, and lectures written on the landscape of Jefferson?s Monticello, combining these with the visual analysis performed in this thesis provides the reader with a clearer understanding of the specific English influences on Monticello.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Effects of Surgical Sterilization upon Home Range Area of Suburban White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) Population</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Beaudette, Aaron</dc:creator>
<dc:description>As white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations continue to increase in suburban environments, local governments are considering ways to manage herd abundance and associated conflicts. Sterilization is one possible non-lethal method for controlling herd density, but little is known about the effects of sterilization on the behavior of female deer in suburban areas. We compared home range areas for a sample of sterilized (treated) female deer with home range sizes of reproductively-active females (controls). Between January 2002 and March 2005, 61 deer were captured, radio-collared, and located weekly using radio-telemetry in the Village of Cayuga Heights, New York. Sixteen deer were surgically sterilized. Neither annual nor seasonal average home range areas were significantly different between the control and sterilized groups. In 2004, a subset of the study population (long-term resident deer present in both 2002 and 2004), did have significantly different annual average home range areas (F= 5.946, df = 1, P &lt; 0.05). Control (27.7 ha) and sterilized (14.0 ha) long-term residents may have exhibited different home range use because of the behavior of control female deer caring for fawns during summer. The high site fidelity and survivorship of collared female deer indicates that sterilization could potentially have long-term effects, and may cause a slow population decline over several years. Continued resource utilization by sterilized deer would reduce the amount of resources available to reproductively-active immigrant deer.</dc:description>

<dc:title>A Comparison of Nearshore Fish Sampling Gears in Oneida Lake, New York</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McConnachie, Sarah</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sampling and assessment of nearshore fish communities is difficult due to the wide variety of habitats, substrates, and often complex structures. During the summers of 2005 and 2006, we conducted a comparison of ten different gear types, with the intent to develop a long-term sampling protocol of nearshore communities in Oneida Lake, NY. Gear types consisted of nine configurations of fyke nets and one seine. Fyke nets varied by frame size (large vs. small), mesh size (large vs. small), orientation (parallel vs. perpendicular), and the inclusion/exclusion of wings. Summers were broken into two sampling periods, during which 2 different sites were chosen for each of three major substrate types (sandy, rocky, and muddy) for a total of six sites. Student?s t-test indicated significantly higher species richness and total catch during sampling period two. However, few significant differences were observed in any net-to-net comparisons using Tukey?s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD). Catches of key sport fishes, such as smallmouth bass and largemouth bass were significantly higher in smaller meshed nets. In order to maximize ease, efficiency and accuracy, we recommend assessments of nearshore communities take place in sampling period two, using a combination of perpendicularly set medium frame fyke nets, with both large and small mesh sizes. Additional species, not caught by fyke nets, can be supplemented by seining at all sites.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Construction and Optimization of an Interferon Gamma Dipstick Assay for the Detection of Antigen-Specific Cell Mediated Immune Responses</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Elton, Mara</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Since 1957, when interferons were discovered, Interferon gamma (IFN-y) has played a crucial role as a diagnostic tool for both humans and animals. Because IFN-y is an antigen-induced protein produced by blood lymphocytes, namely CD4+ T-cells, it is considered the first and foremost form of defense that the host has against infections. Two pathogens that induce a cell mediated immune response (CMI) are Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), which causes tuberculosis (TB), and Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (Map), which is the causative agent for Johne's disease. Both diseases pose serious health and economic problems for livestock production, particularly cattle. Clinical signs of these diseases are not apparent during the early stages of infection nor are the levels of the mycobacterium high enough to detect. However, since exposure to tuberculin or Johnin antigen by skin testing induces a pathogen-specific CMI response with increased IFN-y, it has been suggested that this assay, in combination, might be useful in the diagnosis of TB or Johne's. However, while IFN-y assays are available, they have qualities that prohibit their routine use in the field. In this study, we report the construction and optimization of a lateral flow assay for determining levels of IFN-y. This assay is also robust, easy-to-use and requires no sophisticated equipment, all qualities that are required for field performance. The format of the assay involves the immobilization of an IFN-y capture antibody onto plastic-backed nitrocellulose membrane using inkjet deposition. Then the sample is allowed to wick vertically up the membrane. Reagents to detect bound IFN-y are then wicked up the membrane and the printed lines of the capture antibody binding IFN-y antigen are developed. Thus far, this assay is sensitive to 1ng/ml IFN-y. When used in combination with skin testing, this IFN-y assay may prove useful in the diagnosis of early mycobacterium infection, and potentially other infections that induce a CMI response.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Structure of BAR and PX Domains of Sorting Nexin 9 Reveals Cooperativity in Membrane Binding</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kaan, Hung Yi Kristal</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) belongs to a larger family of BAR-domain containing proteins. It is characterized by an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a phox homology (PX) domain, and a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs-homology (BAR) domain. Together with clathrin and dynamin, it functions mainly in the endocytic pathway to sort proteins. SNX9 has also been shown to regulate receptor-mediated endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), by its interaction with Activated Cdc42-associated kinase-2 (ACK2), thus implicating a role for SNX9 in signal transduction.&#xd;
&#xd;
Although the main cellular functions of SNX9 have been brought to light, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which this multi-domain protein participates in endocytosis and signaling. It is also unclear if and how the protein is regulated. In order to understand the interactions between the various domains of SNX9, we have crystallized and solved the structure of a shorter construct of SNX9 (here after called SNX9PX-BAR), which consists of only the PX and BAR domains. By analyzing this multi-domain structure and by conducting lipid- and vesicle-binding assays, we are able to gain a better understanding of how the two domains interact to influence the membrane binding ability of SNX9.&#xd;
&#xd;
Our analysis of the structure of SNX9PX-BAR shows a dimeric BAR domain that is moderately curved. The BAR domain forms stable dimers via mainly hydrophobic interactions on the membrane surface. Membrane binding is most likely driven by electrostatic interactions between the PX-BAR domain and the negatively-charged plasma membrane. In addition, the PX domain of SNX9 shows high and specific binding affinity to PI(3)P, which is in high concentrations in early endosomes. Therefore, we propose that SNX9 might be localized to both the plasma membrane and the early endosomes to participate in endocytosis and sorting of vesicles.</dc:description>

<dc:title>An Illustrative Narration of Hypnerotomachia Poliphili Through Gardens of Renaissance</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bahador-zadeh, Yasamin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In many historical eras, gardens have been created to convey ideas that more than just an immediate intention to give pleasure. Almost all great civilizations have produced designs for gardens, pools and fountains that have gone beyond the practical needs and creation of aesthetically pleasing sights and sounds.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis studies the symbolism used in most gardens of the 16th century, inspired by the book Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, written in 1499 by Francesco Colonna. The title of the Hypnerotomachya Poliphili is compounded of three Greek words, Hypnos (sleep), Eros (love), and Mache (strife). The sleep of Poliphilo, the narrator and protagonist, is the occasion for the erotic dream that comprises the entire novel. In the process of finding his lover, the protagonist explains how he adores architecture and gardens, wanders around old graveyards and delights in sculptures. This thesis narrates the novel, Hypnerotomachya Poliphili, through photographs of Italian gardens designed as stages on which the story of Poliphilo takes place. One walks around the gardens of the renaissance and sees the episodes of the story quietly performed through the fountains, sculptures and the design and the layout of the gardens.</dc:description>

<dc:title>A Study of the relationship between mineral rights allocation and oil extraction rates</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Goldman, Joshua</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis examines the relationship between a country?s allocation of mineral rights and the rate of extraction of that country?s oil. Empirical analysis shows that countries with privatized oil industries extract oil more quickly than countries with nationalized industries. However, much of the relationship between mineral rights and extraction rates appears to stem from membership in OPEC. Thus, it is unclear whether mineral rights allocation has a direct effect on oil extraction rates.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Melting the fat away: an analysis of the advertising market for weight-loss products</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gong, Jonathan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The rise in the prevalence of overweight and obesity has reached record levels and has gained national attention with respect to public health initiatives.  The race to develop a pharmaceutical product that can help individuals lose weight has resulted in the release of several fatal products that have been withdrawn.  Meanwhile, the growth of direct to consumer advertising has grown dramatically greatly increasing the autonomy of patients.  This paper analyzed the extent to which firms? respond to the market conditions and research regarding drug advertising.  A unique dataset of print advertisements collected from 26 popular magazines and 2 medical journals was analyzed to assess the textual and visual cues of weight-loss advertisements.  Analyses reveal a concentration of both prescription and over-the-counter advertisements in select magazines varying depending on the target audience.  The targeting of certain populations was further displayed through the systematic differences in the use of effectiveness and risk information.  This paper provides insight into the textual and visual cues used to increase demand and profits of the pharmaceutical firms marketing weight-loss products</dc:description>

<dc:title>Treating a known disease with an unknown cause: an analysis of antidepressant advertisements in popular magazines</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Feldheim, Jayme</dc:creator>
<dc:description>I investigate various dimensions of direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of antidepressant medication; specifically causes of depression, self-diagnosis, benefits and risks, and type of appeal used in the advertisements. My study tracks the history of depression, the development of antidepressant medication, and the regulation of psychotropic drug advertisements.   My data utilizes all advertisements that appeared since 1995 in the 26 most popular consumer magazines.  I analyze these advertisements both by brand and by what magazine the ad appeared in.  My findings indicate that this DTC advertising does an adequate job of addressing the causes of depression, does not overly encourage self-diagnosis, mentions side-effects more frequently than benefits but minimizes their severity, and overwhelmingly frames depression as a white, adult female condition.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The overall and differential effect of the Sarbanes-Oxley act on US publicly traded companies</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wong, May</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted in July 2002 in response to major accounting scandals.  This thesis investigates the announcement effects surrounding the passage of SOX to examine the differential impact of SOX on U.S. publicly traded companies.  As the Act requires greater transparency of financial reporting and imposes burden on managers through mandatory CEO/CFO certification of financial statements, the associated compliance costs create a significant loss in total market value that amounts to $1.4 trillion (Zhang 2005).  It is predicted that SOX has a disproportionate negative impact on small firms due to the fixed cost component of the compliance costs and the characteristics of small firms (i.e. they compete on flexibility but SOX limits it).  Previous studies show that the imposed compliance costs lead to a significant number of firms going dark or private in the post-SOX period, which suggests that the imposed compliance costs outweigh the induced benefits of SOX to shareholders (Engel 2004).  While past studies have been done to examine the effect of SOX on public firms in general, this thesis is specifically interested in how different firm sizes react differentially to the events leading the passage of SOX.  Through the event study methodology, the event day effect on stock returns and abnormal returns will be examined to see if the market also perceives the Act to have a negative impact on firms.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine how individual differences in cognitive and personality factors contribute to commissions of false memory. Seventy-eight Cornell University students were tested using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm to elicit false recall. Word lists varied in qualitative components such as concreteness and associative strength. Participants completed a task assessing field dependence and surveys measuring mental absorption and creativity. Results showed similar trends in false recall rates to previous studies. Findings also revealed significant associations between creation of false memories and field dependence, less detailed mental imagery, and lower levels of self-assessed creativity. Concreteness level was found to be an important list-based factor in explaining how individual differences trigger false memory creation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We used the theoretical framework of fuzzy-trace theory to explore framing effects in young adults and their relationship to real world risk perceptions and behaviors. One hundred and two Cornell University undergraduates completed a decision making task involving hypothetical money and completed a survey that assessed their level of gist-based (intuitive) thinking about risk, verbatim (quantitative) risk perceptions, sexual history, and various personality traits. The decision making task used a within-subjects framing design; each participant chose between taking a sure option and gamble for problems varying in magnitude and risk level. Each problem in the gain frame was analogous to one in the loss frame. An overall standard framing pattern (risk aversion for gains, risk seeking for losses) was observed. Preference for the gamble also decreased with increasing levels of risk and magnitude of outcomes. Individual differences in task performance related to a number of survey measures. Most importantly, susceptibility to framing was linked to sexual activity, a measure of risky sexual behavior. Standard framers had the fewest number of sexual partners while reverse framers had the most. Furthermore, sexual activity negatively correlated with gist-based thinking about risk. Gambling in the gain frame correlated positively with sensation seeking scores, which correlated negatively with gist-based thinking. Overall gambling negatively correlated with intentions to use birth control. These results have implications for using framing tasks to study real world behavior and for the use of gist-based interventions to reduce young adult risk taking.</dc:description>

Developmentalists have debated the influence of peer and family norms and values on adolescent development and decision making practices for some time. In my work, I examined the relations between both parent values and friend norms and adolescent decision making. Additionally, I investigated the interactions between fuzzy-trace constructs of gist and verbatim thinking and parent values and friend norms. The results support the notion that family and peers both have salient influences on decision making in adolescents. Peers and parents also appear to influence the level of gist-based thinking that adolescents engage in, an indication that certain interactions with friends and parents can influence decision making maturity. Finally, the interaction between fuzzy-trace constructs and values reflects variance in several past behaviors and future intentions. The implications for this research are that interventions to promote reduced risky decision making in adolescents can be aimed at influencing their perception of family and peer norms, as well as increasing their capacity for more protective gist-based thinking.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study evaluated the efficacy of the Mind Reading interactive computer software to remediate emotion recognition deficits in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Six unmedicated children with ASD and 11 unmedicated non-clinical control subjects participated in the study. The clinical sample used the Mind Reading software for five 30-45 minute sessions. The control subjects did not receive training, and were evaluated only on pre- and post-test performance to assess practice effects. Results showed that participants with ASD scored significantly higher on the post-test than on the pre-test. As level of emotion difficulty increased, mean scores on the pretest decreased, indicating that difficulty level had a valid effect. Findings also revealed that neither age nor diagnosis was correlated with performance or with one another. In addition, a trend indicated that greater initial performance leads to greater gains through training. The Mind Reading computer software appears to significantly improve the emotion recognition abilities in children with ASD.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study demonstrated that exposure to chaotic home environments predicted academic achievement in thirteen year old, rural adolescents (N = 145) living in Upstate New York. It was hypothesized learned helplessness may mediate the relationship between childhood environment and academic achievement in adolescence. In this thesis I propose a unique pathway to explain poor academic achievement in early adolescents living in chaotic environments as mediated by learned helplessness. Regression analysis revealed learned helplessness as a mediator between chaotic environments and academic achievement. Young adolescents with high levels of home chaos had higher levels of learned helplessness, which resulted in lower English and Math grades. Confounding covariance with income is discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The Cost of Living in Poverty: Long-Term Effects of Allostatic Load on Working Memory</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Schamberg, Michelle</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>Poverty, Income, Allostatic Load, Stress, Working Memory, Neurocognitive Functioning</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Compared to their middle-income peers, adolescents reared in poverty perform less accurately on neurocognitive tasks. Previous research has not delineated an underlying mechanism that would account for these deficits in cognition. Allostatic load is a likely contributor as physiological stress in the brain disrupts neurogenesis, decreases the connections between dendrites, and induces atrophy in areas essential for working memory. The interplay between poverty, allostatic load, and working memory has not been previously studied. The current investigation examines the influence of cumulative, physiological "wear and tear" (at ages 9 and 13) on working memory functioning (at age 17), in a low- and middle-income sample (N= 68 and 102 per group, respectively). As predicted, proportion of life spent in poverty was inversely related to working memory functioning, with decreased accuracy for individuals living in persistent poverty. This pathway was fully mediated by increased allostatic load in childhood and early adolescence. These findings have implications for future health and education policies, and have provided preliminary evidence for the role of allostatic load on neurocognitive functioning.</dc:description>
